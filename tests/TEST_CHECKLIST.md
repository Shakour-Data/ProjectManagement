# Test Checklist for Project Management System

## 1. Commit Progress Generation Tests
- [x] Verify commit grouping and categorization by file and directory.
- [x] Validate generation of conventional commit messages.
- [x] Confirm commit progress JSON generation with correct structure and data.
- [x] Test simplified progress mapping aligns with ProgressCalculator expectations.

## 2. Commit-Task Database Tests
- [x] Validate creation and updating of commit-task JSON database.
- [x] Verify inclusion of detailed commit metadata (author, email, date, branch, parent commits).
- [x] Test handling of missing or failed metadata retrieval gracefully.
- [x] Confirm real-time updates during auto commit and push process.

## 3. Progress Calculation Tests
- [x] Verify loading of input JSON files (tasks, workflow, commit progress).
- [x] Test calculation of commit progress per task.
- [x] Validate workflow progress calculation.
- [x] Confirm combined progress calculation with weighting.
- [x] Test dynamic importance and urgency scoring.
- [x] Verify enrichment of tasks with progress, importance, urgency, and score.

## 4. Integration Tests
- [x] Test end-to-end flow from commit detection to progress calculation.
- [x] Validate integration of commit-task database with progress calculation.
- [ ] Confirm generation of reports and dashboards based on enriched tasks.

## 5. Error Handling and Edge Cases
- [ ] Test behavior with no changes or empty commit history.
- [ ] Validate handling of malformed or missing input files.
- [ ] Confirm robustness against git command failures.

## 6. Performance Tests (Optional)
- [ ] Measure performance of commit progress generation on large commit sets.
- [ ] Evaluate efficiency of progress calculation and enrichment.
