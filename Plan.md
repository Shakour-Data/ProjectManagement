# Project Management Software Rewrite Plan

## Objective
Rewrite the Project Management software to ensure all components (installer, backend, frontend) work seamlessly and in a fully integrated manner. Preserve all existing functionalities and improve maintainability and user experience.

  - Installation of Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  - Installation of Node.js dependencies and building frontend assets.
  - Initialization and setup of the project environment.
- Provide a user-friendly interface guiding through installation steps.
- Include error handling and logging for troubleshooting.

### 4. Project Architecture Review and Refactoring
- Review current project structure and modularize components for better maintainability.
- Separate concerns clearly between backend, frontend, and installer.
- Refactor code where necessary to improve readability, performance, and extensibility.
- Ensure all existing features and workflows are preserved.
- **Status: Pending**
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] Analyze current architecture and identify modularization opportunities. Done: Yes
  - [x] Refactor backend code for clarity and performance. Done: Yes

- **Status: Pending**
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Review existing documentation and identify gaps. Done: 
  - [ ] Write missing documentation sections. Done: 
  - [ ] Update existing documents for accuracy. Done: 
  - [ ] Create architecture diagrams. Done: 
  - [ ] Create workflow and data flow diagrams. Done: 
  - [ ] Create deployment diagrams. Done: 
  - [ ] Create UML diagrams document. Done:
