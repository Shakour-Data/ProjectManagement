# Project Management Software Rewrite Plan

## Objective
Rewrite the Project Management software to ensure all components (installer, backend, frontend) work seamlessly and in a fully integrated manner. Preserve all existing functionalities and improve maintainability and user experience.

  - Creation and activation of Python virtual environment.
  - Installation of Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  - Installation of Node.js dependencies and building frontend assets.
  - Initialization and setup of the project environment.
- Provide a user-friendly interface guiding through installation steps.
- Include error handling and logging for troubleshooting.

  - [x] Automate Python dependencies installation. Done: Yes
  - [x] Automate Node.js dependencies installation and frontend build. Done: Yes
  - [x] Implement error handling and logging. Done: 

### 2. Environment Setup Automation
- Automate creation of a Python virtual environment if not present.
- Automate installation of all Python dependencies.

   - Store diagrams as SVG or image files in a `diagrams` directory.
   - Use interactive JavaScript libraries (e.g., Mermaid.js) embedded in pages for UML, DFD, and BPMN diagrams.
   - Provide separate pages or sections for each diagram type with intuitive navigation.

4. **UI/UX Design**
   - Create a clean, responsive layout featuring a sidebar menu and main content area.
