# Project Management Software Rewrite Plan

## Objective
Rewrite the Project Management software to ensure all components (installer, backend, frontend) work seamlessly and in a fully integrated manner. Preserve all existing functionalities and improve maintainability and user experience.

---

## Plan Overview

### 1. Installer Redesign
- Replace the current PyInstaller + Flask installer with a Tkinter-based GUI installer.
- The installer will automate:
  - Creation and activation of Python virtual environment.
  - Installation of Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  - Installation of Node.js dependencies and building frontend assets.
  - Initialization and setup of the project environment.
- Provide a user-friendly interface guiding through installation steps.
- Include error handling and logging for troubleshooting.

### 2. Environment Setup Automation
- Automate creation of a Python virtual environment if not present.
- Automate installation of all Python dependencies.
- Automate installation of Node.js and npm dependencies in the frontend directory.
- Automate building the frontend assets (e.g., using `npm run build` or equivalent).
- Verify all installations and provide feedback to the user.

### 3. Unified Startup and Integration
- Provide scripts or commands to start the backend API server and frontend server.
- Optionally integrate backend and frontend startup into the installer for one-click launch.
- Ensure backend and frontend communicate correctly and are accessible.
- Provide clear instructions or UI elements to manage the running services.

### 4. Project Architecture Review and Refactoring
- Review current project structure and modularize components for better maintainability.
- Separate concerns clearly between backend, frontend, and installer.
- Refactor code where necessary to improve readability, performance, and extensibility.
- Ensure all existing features and workflows are preserved.

### 5. Testing and Validation
- After implementation, perform thorough testing including:
  - Installer functionality and error handling.
  - Backend API endpoints and services.
  - Frontend UI and user interactions.
  - Integration between backend and frontend.
- Use both automated tests and manual user acceptance testing.
- Document test cases and results.

### 6. Documentation
- Update or create documentation for:
  - Installation and setup process.
  - Usage instructions for the software.
  - Developer guidelines for future maintenance.

## Next Steps
- Begin with the installer redesign using Tkinter.
- Provide progress updates and seek feedback regularly.
- After installer completion, proceed with environment setup automation.
- Continue with integration, refactoring, and testing phases.
