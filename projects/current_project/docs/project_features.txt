   - Clear error handling, user guidance, and comprehensive logging for audit and troubleshooting.

10. Backup and Recovery:
    - Automated backups of project management state, documentation, and configuration files.
    - Robust recovery mechanisms to handle data loss or corruption, ensuring project continuity.

11. Project Management Standards Integration:
    - Full compliance with PMBOK standards including resource, cost, risk, and quality management.
    - Detailed resource allocation and management features, including tracking availability, utilization, and skill sets.
    - Comprehensive cost management capabilities covering budgeting, expense tracking, and forecasting.
    - Support for Agile methodologies with Scrum framework implementation including ceremonies, roles, and artifacts.
    - Kanban boards for visual task management and workflow optimization.
    - Integration of Gantt charts and traditional project management methods alongside Agile features.
    - Support for multi-method project management allowing users to switch or combine methodologies as needed.

Usage Workflow:
---------------
- Install the tool at the start of the project.
- Initialize the project management state automatically.
- Provide creative task inputs informally via VS Code chat interface.
- The tool converts inputs into formal tasks and manages them on GitHub.
- Progress is tracked and updated automatically based on commit history and task status.
- Regular reports, dashboards, and notifications keep collaborators informed.
- Feedback and adjustments are handled seamlessly through GitHub and VS Code chat.

Task Breakdown and Workflow:
----------------------------
- The project schedule is hierarchically divided into at least 6 levels.
- Each level is subdivided into multiple sections, with the lowest level representing individual tasks.
- Each task undergoes a complete workflow including coding, testing, documentation, and review before completion.
- This hierarchical and detailed breakdown ensures comprehensive tracking and management of all project activities.

Conclusion:
-----------
This tool is designed to be the ultimate project management assistant for software projects, ensuring smooth, transparent, and efficient collaboration.
