Project Management Tool - Implementation Plan

Overview:
---------
This document outlines the proposed tools, technologies, and approach for implementing the project management tool as specified in the projectÙ€features.txt file.

Technology Stack:
-----------------
1. Backend Framework:
   - Flask (Python): A lightweight and flexible web framework to build RESTful APIs for handling GitHub integration, task management, automation workflows, and communication with the VS Code extension.

2. Core Logic and Automation:
   - Python: For implementing the core functionalities such as parsing creative inputs, task prioritization, scheduling, documentation management, progress tracking, and automation.
   - GitHub API: To interact with GitHub Issues, Projects, Pull Requests, Wikis, and Actions for seamless integration and automation.
   - GitHub Actions: For workflow automation, CI/CD, notifications, and scheduled tasks like daily report generation.

3. VS Code Integration:
   - VS Code Extension API: To create an extension that provides the chat interface for users to input creative tasks and receive updates.
   - Automatic installation of essential VS Code extensions such as BLACKBOX AI to enhance developer productivity.

4. Data Storage and State Management:
   - Local project files and GitHub repositories will serve as the primary data stores.
   - Use of configuration files and secure storage for GitHub API tokens.

5. Testing:
   - Unit and integration tests using Python testing frameworks (e.g., pytest).
   - API endpoint testing using tools like Curl or Postman.
   - End-to-end testing of the VS Code extension and backend integration.

6. Reporting and Dashboards:
   - Generation of markdown or text-based reports stored in the repository.
   - Real-time dashboards integrated within VS Code or GitHub Projects.

7. Security:
   - Secure handling of authentication tokens.
   - Role-based access control for multi-user scenarios.
   - Compliance with GitHub API rate limits and best practices.

Development Approach:
---------------------
- Agile iterative development with continuous integration using GitHub Actions.
- Frequent commits and automated progress tracking based on commit history.
- Automated testing and deployment pipelines.
- User feedback integration through VS Code chat and GitHub workflows.

This plan ensures a modular, scalable, and fully automated project management tool that leverages existing free tools and services to maximize productivity and minimize manual overhead.

Please review and confirm or provide any additional input before implementation begins.
