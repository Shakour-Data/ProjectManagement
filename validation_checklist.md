# Validation Checklist for Project Architecture Post-Refactoring

This checklist is designed to validate feature completeness and correctness after the refactoring of the project architecture.

## Backend

- [ ] Verify all API endpoints respond correctly (happy path and error cases).
- [ ] Confirm data persistence and retrieval work as expected.
- [ ] Validate integration with database and repository layers.
- [ ] Check performance and response times of key backend services.
- [ ] Ensure security measures (authentication, authorization) are intact.

## Frontend

- [ ] Confirm all UI components render correctly.
- [ ] Test navigation flows between pages and components.
- [ ] Validate user input handling and form submissions.
- [ ] Check error handling and display of error messages.
- [ ] Verify integration with backend APIs (data fetching and posting).
- [ ] Test responsiveness and layout on different screen sizes.

## Installer

- [ ] Validate virtual environment creation and activation.
- [ ] Confirm Python dependencies installation.
- [ ] Verify Node.js and npm dependencies installation.
- [ ] Test frontend build process.
- [ ] Check backend and frontend server startup and shutdown.
- [ ] Verify backend-frontend communication.
- [ ] Confirm user instructions and UI controls function correctly.
- [ ] Test error handling and logging during installation.

## General

- [ ] Run unit tests and integration tests.
- [ ] Perform manual exploratory testing of key workflows.
- [ ] Review logs for errors or warnings.
- [ ] Confirm documentation is up to date with refactoring changes.

This checklist should be used as a guide to systematically validate the project after refactoring.
