# Check Progress Dashboard Update Module

## Overview
The `check_progress_dashboard_update` module is responsible for updating the progress dashboard report for the project management tool. It reads the existing dashboard content, generates a new progress dashboard report based on the current task management data, and updates the dashboard file if changes are detected.

## Functions

- `read_file(path)`
  - Reads the content of a file at the given path.
  - Returns the file content as a string or an empty string if the file is not found.

- `main()`
  - Main function that:
    - Reads the current progress dashboard content.
    - Creates a `TaskManagement` instance and generates a work breakdown structure (WBS) from an idea.
    - Generates a progress dashboard report using the `generate_progress_dashboard_report` function.
    - Reads the updated dashboard content and compares it with the previous content.
    - Prints whether the dashboard was updated or not.

## Usage
The module can be run as a script to update the progress dashboard report automatically.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
