# Detailed Explanation of Architectural_Design.json

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `Architectural_Design.json` file located in the `Modeling/System_Design` directory. This file is part of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the software project and describes the "Architectural Design" phase within the System Design category.

---

## File Purpose

The `Architectural_Design.json` file defines the tasks involved in defining the overall system architecture and components. It breaks down the architectural design into manageable subtasks to facilitate planning, execution, and tracking.

---

## JSON Structure Breakdown

- **id**: `"WBS-Modeling-3.1"`  
  Unique identifier for this WBS element, indicating it belongs to the Modeling phase and is the 3.1 task.

- **name**: `"Architectural Design"`  
  The name of this task.

- **description**: `"Define the overall system architecture and components."`  
  A brief description of the task's purpose.

- **level_0** to **level_3**:  
  These fields represent the hierarchical levels of the task within the overall project:  
  - `level_0`: "Software Project" (top-level project)  
  - `level_1`: "Modeling" (major phase)  
  - `level_2`: "System Design" (sub-phase)  
  - `level_3`: "Architectural Design" (current task)

- **subtasks**: An array of subtasks that further break down the architectural design task. Each subtask has:  
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the subtask (e.g., `"WBS-Modeling-3.1.1"`)  
  - `name`: Name of the subtask (e.g., `"Define System Components"`)  
  - `description`: Description of the subtask's purpose  
  - `level_4`: Hierarchical level name for the subtask  
  - `subtasks`: An empty array indicating no further breakdown for these subtasks

---

## Subtasks Description

1. **Define System Components**  
   Identify and define major system components that make up the architecture.

2. **Establish Component Interactions**  
   Define interactions and interfaces between the system components.

3. **Select Architectural Patterns**  
   Choose appropriate architectural styles and patterns suitable for the system.

4. **Document Architecture**  
   Prepare detailed architectural design documents.

5. **Review Architecture**  
   Conduct review sessions to validate and improve the architecture.

## How to Use This File

- This file serves as an input to project management tools to organize and track architectural design tasks.
- Each subtask can be assigned to team members, scheduled, and monitored.
- The hierarchical structure allows for clear visibility of task dependencies and progress.

---

## Extending the Structure

- This file covers the WBS structure up to level 4, which represents common tasks shared across many software projects.
- To tailor the WBS to your specific project goals, you should further break down each level 4 subtask into three additional levels (e.g., `level_5`, `level_6`, `level_7`).
- These additional levels should be created based on the unique requirements and details of your project.
- When adding these levels, maintain consistent `id` and `level_n` naming conventions to preserve the hierarchy.
- This approach allows you to customize the WBS JSON files to fit your project's specific needs while leveraging the common foundational structure provided.

This detailed explanation should help users understand the role and structure of the `Architectural_Design.json` file, how it fits into the overall project WBS, and how to extend it to meet specific project requirements.
