# Implementation Plan

*Last updated: 2024-06-10*

## Overview

This document presents a detailed and comprehensive implementation plan for the Project Management Tool, outlining the technologies, architecture, development methodology, key components, and phased development roadmap aligned with the current project direction and goals.

## Technology Stack

### Backend Framework
- Flask (Python): A lightweight, modular web framework used to build RESTful APIs that handle GitHub integration, task management, automation workflows, and communication with the VS Code extension.

### Core Logic and Automation
- Python: Implements core functionalities including parsing creative user inputs, intelligent task prioritization, scheduling, dependency management, documentation handling, progress tracking, and automation of workflows.
- GitHub API: Facilitates seamless integration with GitHub Issues, Projects, Pull Requests, Wikis, and Actions to automate project management tasks.
- GitHub Actions: Powers workflow automation, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), scheduled tasks such as daily report generation, and notification systems.

### VS Code Integration
- VS Code Extension API: Provides an interactive chat interface within VS Code for users to input creative tasks and receive real-time updates.
- Automated installation of essential VS Code extensions (e.g., BLACKBOX AI) to enhance developer productivity and streamline workflows.

### Data Storage and State Management
- Local project files and GitHub repositories serve as primary data stores.
- Configuration files and secure encrypted storage manage GitHub API tokens and project state.

### Testing Strategy
- Unit and integration tests using Python testing frameworks (e.g., pytest) to ensure code quality and reliability.
- API endpoint testing with tools like Curl or Postman to validate backend services.
- End-to-end testing of the VS Code extension and backend integration to verify seamless user experience.

### Reporting and Dashboards
- Automated generation of markdown and text-based reports stored within the project repository.
- Real-time dashboards integrated into VS Code and GitHub Projects for continuous project monitoring.

### Security and Permissions
- Secure handling and encrypted storage of authentication tokens.
- Role-based access control mechanisms to manage multi-user permissions.
- Compliance with GitHub API rate limits and best practices to maintain system stability.

## Development Approach

- Agile iterative development with continuous integration and delivery using GitHub Actions.
- Frequent commits with automated progress tracking based on commit history.
- Automated testing and deployment pipelines to ensure quality and rapid delivery.
- User feedback integration through VS Code chat interface and GitHub workflows to continuously improve the tool.
