This document provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of all JSON files used in the Project Management System, including their data sources, formation processes, usage, and interrelationships. This consolidated document replaces individual JSON file standard documents to provide clarity and avoid confusion.

## Overview of JSON Files

| JSON File Name | Data Source | Formation Process | Usage / Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| detailed\_wbs.json | User Input | Created/edited by users defining WBS | Used by task management, progress tracking |
| human\_resources.json | User Input | Created/edited by users defining resources | Used by resource allocation, scheduling |
| wbs\_data.json | System/User Input | Parsed from detailed WBS or imported | Used by task import, database updates |
| wbs\_scores.json | System Generated | Calculated importance/urgency scores | Used by prioritization, reporting |
| resource\_allocation.json | User Input | Defined resource allocations to tasks | Used by resource leveling, scheduling |
| task\_resource\_allocation.json | User Input | Detailed task-resource assignments | Used by resource leveling, task execution |
| workflow\_definition.json | User Input | Defined workflow stages and weights | Used by progress tracking, reporting |
| commit\_progress.json | System Generated | Generated by auto\_commit module tracking commits | Used by progress calculator, reporting |
| commit\_task\_database.json | System Generated | Updated by auto\_commit module with commit-task mappings | Used by reporting, audit trails |

## Additional Detailed Documentation

For more detailed and precise documentation on critical JSON files, please refer to the following documents:

* [commit\_task\_database.json Standard](./commit_task_database.md)
* [Detailed JSON Workflow and Documentation Process](./json_workflow_detailed.md)
* [workflow\_definition.json Standard](./workflow_definition_detailed.md)
* **Data Source:** Provided and maintained by users to define the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
* **Formation:** Users create or edit this file to specify tasks, subtasks, durations, and dependencies.
* **Usage:** Consumed by task management modules, progress calculators, and reporting tools.
* **Relationships:** Serves as the base structure for wbs\_data.json and influences resource allocation files.

### human\_resources.json

* **Data Source:** User-maintained list of human resources with attributes.
* **Formation:** Created and updated by project managers or HR personnel.
* **Usage:** Used by resource allocation and leveling modules to assign resources to tasks.
* **Relationships:** Linked with resource\_allocation.json and task\_resource\_allocation.json.

### wbs\_data.json

* **Data Source:** Derived from detailed\_wbs.json or imported from external sources.
* **Formation:** Created by parsing detailed\_wbs.json or through import modules.
* **Usage:** Used for database updates, task imports, and progress tracking.
* **Relationships:** Reflects the WBS structure and is linked to wbs\_scores.json for prioritization.

### wbs\_scores.json

* **Data Source:** System-generated based on task importance and urgency calculations.
* **Formation:** Calculated by importance\_urgency\_calculator and related modules.
* **Usage:** Used to prioritize tasks in reporting and scheduling.
* **Relationships:** Depends on wbs\_data.json and influences task prioritization.

### resource\_allocation.json & task\_resource\_allocation.json

* **Data Source:** User-defined resource assignments to tasks.
* **Formation:** Created by project managers to allocate resources.
* **Usage:** Used by resource leveling and task execution modules.
* **Relationships:** Linked to human\_resources.json and detailed\_wbs.json.

### workflow\_definition.json

* **Data Source:** User-defined workflow stages and weights.
* **Formation:** Created to define the lifecycle stages of tasks.
* **Usage:** Used by progress tracking, reporting, and automation modules.
* **Relationships:** Influences commit\_progress.json and progress calculations.

### commit\_progress.json

* **Data Source:** System-generated by auto\_commit module tracking commit progress.
* **Formation:** Generated by analyzing git changes and commit history.
* **Usage:** Used by progress\_calculator and reporting modules to monitor project progress.
* **Relationships:** Reflects progress on tasks defined in detailed\_wbs.json and workflow\_definition.json.

### commit\_task\_database.json

* **Data Source:** System-generated mapping commits to tasks with metadata.
* **Formation:** Updated by auto\_commit module with commit hashes, messages, and task associations.
* **Usage:** Used for audit trails, reporting, and traceability.
* **Relationships:** Linked to commit\_progress.json and task definitions.

* Users provide input JSON files defining project structure, resources, and workflows.
* System modules parse and generate derived JSON files for task management and scoring.
* Auto\_commit module tracks commit progress and updates progress-related JSON files.
* Reporting modules consume progress and task data for dashboards and reports.
