## Overview

This document explains the complete process of the project management package from start to finish. It covers all stages, modules, and workflows involved in managing a project effectively using the package.

## 1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Preparation

* The process begins with preparing a comprehensive Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
* The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the project into manageable sections and tasks.
* The package supports combining a default project structure with user-defined activities at multiple levels.
* WBS parts are stored as JSON files in the `wbs_parts` folder.
* The `wbs_merger.py` module merges these parts into a detailed WBS JSON file.

## 2. Importance and Urgency Calculation

* The `import_wbs_to_tasks` module calculates importance and urgency scores for tasks based on the detailed WBS.
* These scores help prioritize tasks effectively.
* The results are saved as `wbs_scores.json`.

## 3. Commit Progress Management

* The `commit_progress_manager` module tracks progress through commits.
* It updates progress status based on commit history and task completion.

## 4. JSON Data Linking

* The `json_data_linker` module generates links between WBS tasks and related resources.
* This ensures data consistency and traceability across the project.

## 5. Resource Allocation

* The `resource_allocation_manager` module enriches resource allocation data.
* It manages assignment of resources to tasks and optimizes usage.

## 6. Resource Definition

* Resources are defined and managed as part of the project inputs.
* Resource definitions include human resources, materials, equipment, and other assets.
* These definitions are stored in JSON files under `user_inputs/resource_allocation.json` and related folders.
* The package links resources to tasks and manages their allocation dynamically during project execution.

## 7. Reporting and Dashboards

* The `project_management_system` module generates various reports and dashboards.
* Reports include snapshot reports at key milestones and trend reports showing progress over time.
* Reports are saved in the `reports` directory and include dashboards for visual insights.

## 8. Testing and Validation

* The package includes thorough testing modules to validate each stage.
* Realistic integration tests simulate project timelines, commits, delays, and report generation.
* Testing ensures robustness, correctness, and performance.

## 9. Usage Workflow

* Prepare or update WBS parts JSON files.
* Run the WBS merger to generate detailed WBS.
* Calculate importance and urgency scores.
* Update commit progress.
* Generate JSON data links.
* Allocate resources.
* Generate reports and dashboards.
* Review reports and adjust project plans accordingly.

## 10. Notes

* The package supports iterative project management with weekly progress updates.
* Delays and testable scenarios are simulated realistically in integration tests.
* Reports include both snapshot and trend analyses for comprehensive monitoring.
