<h1 id="project-management-package-scenario-without-ai">Project Management Package Scenario (Without AI)</h1>
<h2 id="initial-setup-and-installation">Initial Setup and Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The user creates an empty project folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Project Management package is installed into the project folder.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The package files and folders are not tracked by the user's project Git repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Git repository is initialized in the project folder.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Essential files such as <code>requirements.txt</code>, <code>.gitignore</code>, and <code>README.md</code> are created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <code>Docs</code> folder is created for project documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Python virtual environment is created within the project folder.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual environment files and folders are excluded from Git tracking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The required Python packages listed in <code>requirements.txt</code> are installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system instructs the user to add JSON files for the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) parts under the directory:<br />
<code>project_inputs/PM_JSON/user_inputs/wbs_parts</code>  </p>
</li>
<li>The user must add three levels of WBS parts to plan the project.  </li>
<li>The system lists the expected JSON filenames and paths one by one.  </li>
<li>The user completes each JSON file according to the provided standards and confirms by pressing Enter.  </li>
<li>
<p>The system validates each JSON file against general and package-specific standards before proceeding to the next file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user defines the human resources JSON file as per the system's instructions and standards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="project-planning-and-scheduling">Project Planning and Scheduling</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The system performs resource allocation for the lowest-level WBS activities (tasks) based on the user-defined human resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system estimates the duration (in hours) for each activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system determines the dependencies (predecessors and successors) for each activity.  </p>
<ul>
<li>It adds a start milestone activity for activities without predecessors (project start).  </li>
<li>It adds an end milestone activity for activities without successors (project end).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system performs resource leveling to optimize resource usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user provides the project start date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system calculates the start and end dates for each activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting from the lowest WBS level, the system aggregates durations, costs, and other calculations up to higher levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system announces that the initial project schedule is created, including total project duration and cost (human resource cost only).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system generates various dashboards and reports for the initial project plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system provides filtering and sorting capabilities for activities and higher WBS levels based on all scheduling attributes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="project-monitoring-and-control">Project Monitoring and Control</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>During project execution, the package monitors the project by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determining priority, importance, and scores for activities and aggregating these to higher WBS levels.  </li>
<li>
<p>If two activities have the same priority and importance, the one in a group with higher priority and importance receives a higher score.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determining the order of activities and managing their execution by team members.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generating dashboards and reports related to activity execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managing workflow for activities designated for execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating commits after completing workflow parts and updating project progress percentage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generating all relevant reports at the end of each workday (e.g., 6 PM daily).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updating dashboards after each commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Checking if the workflow is complete:  </p>
</li>
<li>If yes, return to priority determination step.  </li>
<li>If no, continue workflow execution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All user inputs must comply with the package's JSON standards and formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system guides the user through each step, providing instructions and validation feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The package does not use AI for any of the above processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The package focuses on automation, consistency, and adherence to project management best practices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>This scenario replaces any previous AI-based automation with a user-interactive, standards-driven project management process.</p>
