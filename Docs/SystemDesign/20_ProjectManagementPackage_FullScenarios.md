# Project Management Package - Full Implementation Scenarios

This document provides a comprehensive description of all implemented scenarios in the Project Management Package, covering user onboarding, setup, JSON input handling, project planning, calculations, monitoring, dashboards, and reporting.

---

## 1. User Onboarding and System Entry

- The user begins by creating an empty project folder on their system.
- The user launches the Project Management frontend application (React-based).
- Upon launch, the user is greeted with a **Setup Wizard** guiding them through initial project setup.
- The user interacts solely through the frontend; no command-line interaction is required.

---

## 2. Setup Wizard

The Setup Wizard automates essential project initialization steps:

1. **Initialize Git Repository**
   - The system checks if a Git repository exists.
   - If not, it initializes a new Git repository in the project folder.

2. **Create or Update `.gitignore`**
   - The system ensures `.gitignore` excludes virtual environment folders (`venv/`, `.venv/`, etc.).

3. **Create `requirements.txt`**
   - If missing, an empty `requirements.txt` is created for the user to add dependencies.

4. **Create Python Virtual Environment**
   - A virtual environment (`venv`) is created in the project folder.

5. **Install Dependencies**
   - Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` are installed into the virtual environment.

- Each step provides real-time status updates and error handling.
- Upon completion, the wizard transitions to the JSON File Upload phase.

---

## 3. JSON File Upload Wizard

- The system fetches a list of expected JSON input files and their target directories.
- The user uploads JSON files one by one, matching expected filenames and locations.
- The system validates file names and basic JSON correctness client-side.
- Uploaded files are saved in the appropriate directories under `project_inputs/PM_JSON/user_inputs/`.
- The wizard provides upload progress and error feedback.
- After all files are uploaded, the wizard proceeds to project planning.

---

## 4. Project Planning Inputs

- The user defines:
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) levels.
  - Human resources.
  - Resource allocations.
  - Project start date.
- These inputs are managed via dedicated frontend forms and saved through backend APIs.
- The system validates inputs against defined standards.

---

## 5. Calculations and Scheduling

- The system performs:
  - Resource allocation for lowest-level WBS activities.
  - Duration estimation for each activity (in hours).
  - Dependency determination (predecessors and successors).
  - Addition of start and end milestone activities.
  - Resource leveling to optimize usage.
  - Scheduling of activities with start and end dates.
  - Aggregation of durations, costs, and other metrics from lower to higher WBS levels.
- Calculations are performed in backend modules and results saved as JSON outputs.

---

## 6. Project Monitoring and Control

- The system continuously monitors project progress by:
  - Calculating priority, importance, and scores for activities and aggregating to higher levels.
  - Managing workflow execution and activity ordering.
  - Creating commits after workflow steps and updating progress percentages.
  - Generating daily reports at the end of each workday.
  - Updating dashboards after each commit.
  - Checking workflow completion and cycling through monitoring steps.

---

## 7. Dashboards and Reporting

- The frontend provides dashboards displaying:
  - Progress reports (task completion status).
  - Priority and urgency visualizations.
  - Cost management summaries.
  - Resource allocation details.
  - Risk management insights.
- Reports are generated based on backend JSON outputs and updated dynamically.
- Users can filter and sort activities and WBS levels based on scheduling attributes.

---

## 8. User Interaction Flow Summary

1. User launches frontend â†’ Setup Wizard starts.
2. Setup Wizard completes project initialization.
3. JSON File Upload Wizard guides user to upload required JSON inputs.
4. User completes project planning inputs.
5. System performs calculations and scheduling.
6. User accesses dashboards and reports.
7. During project execution, monitoring and control features keep project on track.

---

## 9. Notes

- All user inputs must comply with JSON standards defined in the documentation.
- The system is designed for user interaction solely through the frontend.
- Backend APIs support all setup, input handling, calculations, and reporting.
- No AI is used; the system relies on automation and best practices.

This document replaces any previous AI-based automation with a user-interactive, standards-driven project management process.
