# Document Creation Plan for Software Design and Pre-Implementation

## Objective
Create a comprehensive, detailed, and precise set of software design and pre-implementation documents for the project, suitable for handing over to developers for coding. Documents will be based solely on existing files in Docs/SystemDesign and its subfolders.

## Proposed Documents

1. **Project Overview and Final Product Description**  
   - Purpose: Define project goals, scope, and final product features.  
   - Source: 01_project_overview_and_final_product_description.md, final_product_description_en.md, final_product_description_fa.md

2. **Project Features and Functional Specifications**  
   - Purpose: Detail all software features and functional requirements.  
   - Source: 02_project_features_and_functional_specifications.md, project_features_en.md, project_features_fa.md

3. **Implementation Plan**  
   - Purpose: Outline phased development plan, milestones, and methodologies.  
   - Source: 03_implementation_plan.md, implementation_plan_en.md, implementation_plan_fa.md, detailed_implementation_plan_en.md, detailed_implementation_plan_fa.md

4. **Work Breakdown Structure and Project Management Overview**  
   - Purpose: Present hierarchical task breakdown and project management approach.  
   - Source: 04_work_breakdown_structure_and_project_management_overview.md, project_management_package_overview_en.md, project_management_package_overview_fa.md

5. **Requirements Specification Document**  
   - Purpose: Capture detailed functional and non-functional requirements.  
   - Source: 05_requirements_specification_document.md (to be expanded with info from general_instructions and json_standards)

6. **System Design Document**  
   - Purpose: Define system architecture, components, interfaces, and data flow.  
   - Source: 06_system_design_document.md (to be expanded with relevant info from general_instructions and json_standards)

7. **Test Plan and Testing Instructions**  
   - Purpose: Specify testing strategies, test cases, and instructions.  
   - Source: 07_test_plan_and_testing_instructions.md, test_checklist_en.md, test_checklist_fa.md, testing_instructions_en.md, testing_instructions_fa.md

8. **Standard Operating Procedures and Help Documentation**  
   - Purpose: Document SOPs and user help guides.  
   - Source: 08_standard_operating_procedures_and_help_documentation.md, HELP_en.md, HELP_fa.md, general_instructions/

9. **Change Management and Versioning Plan**  
   - Purpose: Describe change control and versioning processes.  
   - Source: 09_change_management_and_versioning_plan.md, json_standards/

10. **Communication, Risk Management, and Documentation Plan**  
    - Purpose: Detail communication protocols, risk management, and documentation standards.  
    - Source: 10_communication_risk_management_and_documentation_plan.md, project_management/

11. **JSON Standards and Workflow Definitions**  
    - Purpose: Define JSON file standards and workflow processes critical for system integration.  
    - Source: json_standards/

12. **General Instructions and Guidelines**  
    - Purpose: Provide stepwise instructions and general guidelines for project execution.  
    - Source: general_instructions/

13. **Reports and Dashboards Overview**  
    - Purpose: Describe reporting mechanisms, dashboards, and metrics tracking.  
    - Source: reports/

## Next Steps
- Confirm this plan with the user.
- Upon approval, proceed to create or expand each document with detailed, precise content extracted and consolidated from the source files.
- Ensure documents are comprehensive and suitable for software developers to implement the system.

## Notes
- All documents will be written in English unless otherwise specified.
- Persian versions exist but will be referenced only if needed.
- No code files will be referenced or used.

Please review and confirm if I should proceed with this detailed document creation plan.
