Dashboard And Reports Plan En



# Combined Dashboard and Reports Plan for Project Management Tool

*Last updated: 2025-07-25*

## Overview

This document outlines the key dashboards and reports that should be developed for the project management tool. It includes both a detailed plan for implementation and a blueprint describing the purpose, key information displayed, and implementation notes for each dashboard and report. It also covers the integration of related tasks into the main project workflow.

---

## Dashboards to be Developed

1. **Progress Dashboard / Progress Report Dashboard**
2. Real-time visualization of project progress
3. Task completion rates, milestones achieved
4. Burn-down and burn-up charts
5. Scrum-specific views: sprint burndown, velocity charts, sprint backlog
6. Overall project completion percentage
7. Breakdown of tasks by status: completed, in progress, pending
8. Progress by WBS levels or project phases
9. Visual charts (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs)
10. Implementation Notes: Aggregate task statuses from JSON inputs and update dynamically
11. **Importance and Urgency Dashboard / Task Priority and Urgency Dashboard**
12. Visualization of tasks based on Eisenhower matrix
13. Highlight critical tasks that are both important and urgent
14. Filter and search capabilities by project phase, assignee, etc.
15. Lists of top priority and urgent tasks
16. Alerts for overdue or high-risk tasks
17. Implementation Notes: Use task attributes to generate sorted lists and matrix
18. **Resource Allocation Dashboard**
19. Overview of resource usage and availability
20. Identification of over-allocated or underutilized resources
21. Human and material resource allocation per task
22. Resource availability and conflicts
23. Utilization rates and workload balance
24. Implementation Notes: Integrate resource JSON files and allocation data
25. **Risk Management Dashboard / Risk and Issue Tracking Dashboard**
26. Tracking identified risks and mitigation status
27. Risk impact and probability heatmaps
28. List of identified risks and issues
29. Status, impact, and mitigation plans
30. Notifications for critical risks
31. Implementation Notes: Track risk data and integrate with task statuses
32. **Cost Management Dashboard**
33. Budget vs actual expenditure tracking
34. Forecasting and variance analysis
35. Cost breakdown by task or phase
36. Implementation Notes: Use cost-related JSON inputs and update regularly

## Reports to be Developed

1. **Importance and Urgency Report**
2. Detailed list of tasks categorized by importance and urgency
3. Includes task metadata, status, and workflow position
4. **Progress Report / Detailed Task Progress Report**
5. Summary of completed, in-progress, and pending tasks
6. Milestone achievement and delays
7. Scrum reports: sprint review, retrospective summaries, velocity reports
8. Comprehensive report on task statuses, progress percentages, and deadlines
9. Contents include task list with status, assigned users, deadlines, progress trends over time, and summary of delayed or stalled tasks
10. Implementation: Extract from task JSON and update with progress tracking
11. **Resource Utilization Report**
12. Detailed resource usage statistics
13. Recommendations for reallocation
14. Analysis of resource usage and availability
15. Contents include resource allocation per task, utilization percentages, over-allocated or under-utilized resources
16. Implementation: Use resource and allocation JSON files
17. **Risk Report / Risk and Issue Report**
18. Comprehensive risk register
19. Status and action plans
20. Summary of project risks and their management status
21. Contents include risk descriptions, impact, probability, mitigation actions, progress, open issues, and resolutions
22. Implementation: Track risk and issue JSON data
23. **Cost Report / Cost Analysis Report**
24. Detailed financial report on project costs
25. Financial overview of project costs
26. Contents include budget adherence, expense tracking, forecasts, and cost variances
27. Implementation: Aggregate cost data from inputs
28. **GitHub Synchronization Report**
29. Status of GitHub integration and task synchronization
30. Contents include open and closed issues linked to tasks, pull request statuses, automated changelogs, and audit trails
31. Implementation: Use GitHub API data and synchronization logs

## Implementation Plan

* Develop JSON structure for Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) if not already present
* Implement parsers to convert project plans into WBS JSON
* Develop modules for calculating task metrics (importance, urgency, progress)
* Create report generation scripts for each report type
* Develop dashboard UI components integrated with backend data
* Add tasks for dashboard and report development into main project task management system
* Implement automated testing for dashboards and reports
* Develop SQLite database to store all report and dashboard data centrally
* Add task for creating and integrating SQLite database into main project workflow

---

## Next Steps

* Verify existence and completeness of WBS JSON file
* Prioritize dashboard and report development tasks
* Begin coding and integration as per plan
