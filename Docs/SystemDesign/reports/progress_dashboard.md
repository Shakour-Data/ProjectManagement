Progress Dashboard



# Progress Dashboard

## Overview

The Progress Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive, real-time visualization of the overall project progress. It helps project managers and team members track task completion, milestone achievements, and sprint performance to ensure the project stays on schedule.

## Purpose

* To offer a clear and up-to-date view of project status.
* To identify bottlenecks and delays early.
* To support Scrum and Agile methodologies with specific sprint metrics.

## Key Features and Metrics

* **Task Completion Rates:** Percentage of tasks completed, in progress, and pending.
* **Milestones Achieved:** Visual indicators of milestone completion.
* **Burn-down and Burn-up Charts:** Track remaining work and progress over time.
* **Scrum-specific Views:** Sprint burndown charts, velocity charts, and sprint backlog status.
* **Progress by WBS Levels or Project Phases:** Breakdown of progress at different levels of the Work Breakdown Structure or project phases.
* **Visual Charts:** Pie charts, bar graphs, and line charts for intuitive data representation.

## Data Sources

* Task status and metadata from project management JSON inputs.
* Milestone definitions and completion status.
* Sprint and backlog data from Agile management tools or JSON files.

## UI/UX Considerations

* Interactive charts with filtering options by project phase, assignee, or date range.
* Responsive design for desktop and mobile views.
* Clear color coding for task statuses and milestones.
* Tooltips and drill-down capabilities for detailed task information.

## Implementation Details

* Backend modules to aggregate and process task and milestone data.
* APIs to serve real-time progress data to the frontend.
* Frontend components built with charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) for dynamic visualization.
* Integration with existing project management system for seamless data flow.

## Testing and Validation

* Unit tests for data aggregation and API endpoints.
* UI tests for chart rendering and interactivity.
* Performance testing to ensure real-time updates do not degrade user experience.

## Next Steps

* Define detailed data schema for progress metrics.
* Develop backend aggregation logic.
* Design and prototype frontend dashboard components.
* Plan integration and testing phases.
