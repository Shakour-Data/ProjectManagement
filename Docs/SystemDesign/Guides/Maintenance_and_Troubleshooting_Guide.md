- Backup locations include `project_management/PM_Backups/` and `SystemInputs/User_Completed/`.
- Automate backups using provided scripts or scheduled tasks.

### 1.2 Updates and Patches

- Apply updates to dependencies via `requirements.txt` and frontend `package.json`.
- Use the setup scripts (`setup_and_run.sh`, `setup_env.sh`) to update environments.
- Monitor GitHub repository for new releases and patches.

### 1.3 Monitoring

- Monitor logs located in `log.txt` and backend service logs.
- Use monitoring tools to track system performance and errors.
- Check dashboards for anomalies or unexpected behavior.

## 2. Troubleshooting

### 2.1 Common Issues

- **Installation Failures:** Verify Python, Node.js, npm, and Git installations.
- **Virtual Environment Issues:** Ensure virtual environment is activated before running commands.
- **JSON Input Errors:** Validate JSON files against standards; use the JSON File Upload Wizard for assistance.
- **API Errors:** Check backend logs for error messages; verify API endpoint availability.
- **Frontend Issues:** Clear browser cache; check frontend server logs.

### 2.2 Logs and Diagnostics

- Review `log.txt` for general system logs.
- Backend API logs provide detailed error information.
- Frontend logs available in browser developer tools.

### 2.3 Recovery

- Restore from backups in case of data corruption or loss.
- Re-run setup scripts to repair environment issues.
- Contact support or open issues on the project repository for unresolved problems.

## 3. Support

- Refer to the comprehensive documentation in the `Docs/` directory.
- Use GitHub Issues for reporting bugs or requesting help.
- Engage with the development team via project communication channels.
