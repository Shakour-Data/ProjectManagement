## Usage Workflow

* Install the tool at the start of the project.
* Initialize the project management state automatically.
* Provide creative task inputs informally via VS Code chat interface.
* The tool converts inputs into formal tasks and manages them on GitHub.
* Progress is tracked and updated automatically based on commit history and task status.
* Regular reports, dashboards, and notifications keep collaborators informed.
* Feedback and adjustments are handled seamlessly through GitHub and VS Code chat.

## Task Breakdown and Workflow

* The project schedule is hierarchically divided into at least 6 levels.
* Each level is subdivided into multiple sections, with the lowest level representing individual tasks.
* Each task undergoes a complete workflow including coding, testing, documentation, and review before completion.
* This hierarchical and detailed breakdown ensures comprehensive tracking and management of all project activities.
