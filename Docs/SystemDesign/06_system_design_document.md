# System Design Document

*Last updated: 2024-07-27*

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the architecture and design of the ProjectManagement system, providing a blueprint for development and future maintenance.

### 1.2 Scope
Covers system architecture, components, interfaces, data flow, and design decisions.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- API: Application Programming Interface
- CLI: Command Line Interface
- CI/CD: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- PMBOK: Project Management Body of Knowledge
- WBS: Work Breakdown Structure

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overview
The system is a modular, Python-based application integrating with GitHub and VS Code. It consists of backend services, a VS Code extension, and automation workflows.

### 2.2 Components
- Backend API: Flask-based RESTful services handling core logic and GitHub integration.
- VS Code Extension: Provides chat interface and user interaction.
- Automation Workflows: GitHub Actions for CI/CD, notifications, and scheduled tasks.
- Data Storage: Local files and GitHub repositories.

### 2.3 Architecture Diagram

## 3. System Components Design

### 3.1 Backend API
- Handles task parsing, prioritization, scheduling, and progress tracking.
- Manages GitHub API interactions for issues, pull requests, and projects.

### 3.2 VS Code Extension
- Provides chat interface for informal user inputs.
- Displays real-time updates and notifications.

### 3.3 Automation Workflows
- Implements CI/CD pipelines.
- Automates report generation and notifications.

## 4. Data Design

### 4.1 Data Models
- Task: Attributes include ID, description, status, priority, dependencies.
- User: Roles and permissions.
- Resource: Human resources, equipment, materials.
- Project: Metadata, timelines, milestones.

### 4.2 Data Flow
- User inputs via VS Code chat are parsed into tasks.
- Tasks are synchronized with GitHub Issues and Projects.
- Progress updates flow from commit history to dashboards.

## 5. Interface Design

### 5.1 User Interface
- VS Code chat interface.
- CLI commands for setup and reporting.

### 5.2 External Interfaces
- GitHub API for project management.
- VS Code Extension API.

## 6. Security Design

- Secure storage of authentication tokens.
- Role-based access control.
- Compliance with GitHub API rate limits.

## 7. Performance Considerations

- Efficient API calls and data processing.
- Scalability to handle multiple projects and users.

## 8. Design Decisions and Rationale

- Use of Flask for lightweight backend.
- Deep GitHub integration for seamless project management.
- VS Code extension for user-friendly interaction.
