# Work Breakdown Structure and Project Management Overview

*Last updated: 2024-07-27*

## 1. Package Process Documentation

### Overview

This document explains the complete process of the ProjectManagement system from start to finish. It covers all stages, modules, and workflows involved in managing a project effectively using the package.

This section consolidates documentation to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project management workflow.

### 1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Preparation

- The process begins with preparing a comprehensive Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
- The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the project into manageable sections and tasks.
- The package supports combining a default project structure with user-defined activities at multiple levels.
- WBS parts are stored as JSON files in the `SystemInputs/user_inputs/wbs_parts` folder.
- The `wbs_merger.py` module merges these parts into a detailed WBS JSON file.

### 2. Importance and Urgency Calculation

- The `import_wbs_to_tasks` module calculates importance and urgency scores for tasks based on the detailed WBS.
- These scores help prioritize tasks effectively.
- The results are saved as `wbs_scores.json`.

## Priority, Urgency, and Eisenhower Matrix Instructions

This section describes the methodology implemented in the project management tool for calculating task priority, urgency, and classification using the Eisenhower matrix, as outlined in the detailed implementation plan.

### Priority and Urgency Calculation

* Priority (Importance) is calculated based on multiple weighted factors including:
  * Task dependencies
  * Critical path involvement
  * Schedule and cost impact
  * Stakeholder priority and risk complexity
  * Resource availability and quality impact
  * Milestone roles and bottleneck potential
  * Reusability frequency
* Urgency is calculated based on factors such as:
  * Deadline proximity
  * Next activity dependencies
  * Risk of delay and immediate decision requirements
  * Stakeholder pressure and limited resource time
  * Competitive advantage and critical issue fixes
  * External schedule coordination and compensatory costs
* Both priority and urgency scores are normalized on a scale from 0 to 100.
* For leaf tasks, scores are calculated directly from these factors.
* For parent tasks, scores are aggregated from their subtasks, typically by averaging.

### Eisenhower Matrix Classification

Tasks are classified into four quadrants based on their priority and urgency scores:

| Quadrant | Priority (Importance) | Urgency | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Do Now | High (≥ 70) | High (≥ 70) | Immediate attention |
| Schedule | High (≥ 70) | Low (< 70) | Plan and schedule |
| Delegate | Low (< 70) | High (≥ 70) | Assign to others |
| Eliminate | Low (< 70) | Low (< 70) | Consider dropping |

### Usage in the Project Management Tool

* The tool automatically calculates these scores based on task metadata and project data.
* Tasks are prioritized and scheduled accordingly.
* The Eisenhower matrix helps focus on critical tasks and optimize resource allocation.
* Scores and classifications are saved in JSON files for reporting and visualization.
* Reports include top tasks in each Eisenhower quadrant.
* Visual dashboards summarize task priorities and urgencies.

### Reference

This methodology is implemented as described in the detailed implementation plan located at:

`projects/current_project/docs/detailed_implementation_plan.txt`

This document ensures alignment between the code implementation and project documentation for priority and urgency calculations and task classification.

### 3. Commit Progress Management

- The `commit_progress_manager` module tracks progress through commits.
- It updates progress status based on commit history and task completion.

### 4. JSON Data Linking

- The `json_data_linker` module generates links between WBS tasks and related resources.
- This ensures data consistency and traceability across the project.

### 5. Resource Allocation

- The `resource_allocation_manager` module enriches resource allocation data.
- It manages assignment of resources to tasks and optimizes usage.

### 6. Resource Definition

- Resources are defined and managed as part of the project inputs.
- Resource definitions include human resources, materials, equipment, and other assets.
- These definitions are stored in JSON files under `SystemInputs/user_inputs/task_resource_allocation.json` and related folders.
- The package links resources to tasks and manages their allocation dynamically during project execution.

### 7. Reporting and Dashboards

- The `project_management_system` module generates various reports and dashboards.
- Reports include snapshot reports at key milestones and trend reports showing progress over time.
- Reports are saved in the `project_management/PM_SystemOutputs/system_outputs/` directory and include dashboards for visual insights.

### 8. Testing and Validation

- The package includes thorough testing modules to validate each stage.
- Realistic integration tests simulate project timelines, commits, delays, and report generation.
- Testing ensures robustness, correctness, and performance.

### 9. Usage Workflow

- Prepare or update WBS parts JSON files.
- Run the WBS merger to generate detailed WBS.
- Calculate importance and urgency scores.
- Update commit progress.
- Generate JSON data links.
- Allocate resources.
- Generate reports and dashboards.
- Review reports and adjust project plans accordingly.

### 10. Notes

## 2. Project Management Package Scenario (Without AI)

### Initial Setup and Installation

1. The user creates an empty project folder.
2. The ProjectManagement package is installed into the project folder.
3. The package files and folders are not tracked by the user's project Git repository.
4. A Git repository is initialized in the project folder.
5. Essential files such as `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, and `README.md` are created.
6. A `Docs` folder is created for project documentation.
7. A Python virtual environment is created within the project folder.
8. Virtual environment files and folders are excluded from Git tracking.
9. The required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` are installed.
10. The system instructs the user to add JSON files for the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) parts under the directory:  
    `SystemInputs/user_inputs/wbs_parts`
11. The user must add three levels of WBS parts to plan the project.
12. The system lists the expected JSON filenames and paths one by one.
13. The user completes each JSON file according to the provided standards and confirms by pressing Enter.
14. The system validates each JSON file against general and package-specific standards before proceeding to the next file.
15. The user defines the human resources JSON file as per the system's instructions and standards.

### Project Planning and Scheduling

1. The system performs resource allocation for the lowest-level WBS activities (tasks) based on the user-defined human resources.
2. The system estimates the duration (in hours) for each activity.
3. The system determines the dependencies (predecessors and successors) for each activity.

   - It adds a start milestone activity for activities without predecessors (project start).
   - It adds an end milestone activity for activities without successors (project end).

4. The system performs resource leveling to optimize resource usage.
5. The user provides the project start date.
6. The system calculates the start and end dates for each activity.
7. Starting from the lowest WBS level, the system aggregates durations, costs, and other calculations up to higher levels.
8. The system announces that the initial project schedule is created, including total project duration and cost (human resource cost only).
9. The system generates various dashboards and reports for the initial project plan.
10. The system provides filtering and sorting capabilities for activities and higher WBS levels based on all scheduling attributes.

### Project Monitoring and Control

1. During project execution, the package monitors the project by:

   - Determining priority, importance, and scores for activities and aggregating these to higher WBS levels.
   - If two activities have the same priority and importance, the one in a group with higher priority and importance receives a higher score.
   - Determining the order of activities and managing their execution by team members.
   - Generating dashboards and reports related to activity execution.
   - Managing workflow for activities designated for execution.
   - Creating commits after completing workflow parts and updating project progress percentage.
   - Generating all relevant reports at the end of each workday (e.g., 6 PM daily).
   - Updating dashboards after each commit.
   - Checking if the workflow is complete:
     - If yes, return to priority determination step.
     - If no, continue workflow execution.

### Notes

- All user inputs must comply with the package's JSON standards and formats.
- The system guides the user through each step, providing instructions and validation feedback.
- The package does not use AI for any of the above processes.
- The package focuses on automation, consistency, and adherence to project management best practices.
