# Instructions for Designing JSON Resource Files for Direct Project Management Usage

This document provides a detailed, standardized guideline for structuring JSON resource files so that they can be directly used by the project management tool without requiring a database. The instructions ensure compatibility with the tool's workflows and enable seamless automation.

---

## 1. Purpose

To enable seamless integration of JSON resource files with the project management system by defining a clear, consistent JSON schema that corresponds directly to the tool's data structures. This facilitates automation in data import, validation, and project management workflows.

---

## 2. JSON Structure and Usage Principles

- Each JSON object represents a task, resource, or other project entity.
- JSON keys correspond to attributes used by the project management tool.
- Data types in JSON should align with expected attribute types (e.g., string, integer, real/float, boolean).
- Hierarchical or nested data should be represented using parent-child relationships via IDs.

---

## 3. Defining JSON Keys and Data Types

- Use consistent and descriptive key names matching the tool's attribute names.
- Supported data types:
  - **String**: For textual data (e.g., task titles, descriptions).
  - **Integer**: For whole numbers (e.g., IDs, levels).
  - **Real/Float**: For decimal numbers (e.g., progress, importance).
  - **Boolean**: For true/false flags (if applicable).
  - **Array**: For lists of related items.
- Avoid complex nested JSON objects; use flat structures with references.

---

## 4. Handling Hierarchical Data

- For hierarchical data like tasks and subtasks:
  - Use a parent-child relationship with a `parent_id` field referencing the parent task's ID.
  - Store subtasks as separate entries with a reference to the parent.
- Avoid deeply nested JSON objects.

## 5. Example JSON Schema for Tasks

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "title": "Define project scope",
    "description": "Outline the project objectives and deliverables",
    "level": 1,
    "importance": 0.8,
    "urgency": 0.6,
    "status": "Not Started",
    "progress": 0.0,
    "parent_id": null
  },
  {
    "id": "1.1",
    "title": "Gather requirements",
    "description": "Collect detailed requirements from stakeholders",
    "level": 2,
    "importance": 0.9,
    "urgency": 0.7,
    "status": "In Progress",
    "progress": 0.5,
    "parent_id": "1"
  }
]
```

---

## 6. Validation and Synchronization

- Validate JSON files against the defined schema before use.
- Use automated scripts to parse JSON and update project state.
- Maintain version control for JSON files to track changes.
- Schedule regular synchronization between JSON resources and project workflows.

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Keep JSON files well-formatted and human-readable.
- Use consistent naming conventions for keys.
- Document the JSON schema clearly.
- Handle missing or optional fields gracefully.
- For large datasets, consider batch processing and incremental updates.

---

## 8. Summary

Designing JSON resource files with clear schema definitions enables efficient automation, data integrity, and project management effectiveness. Following these guidelines ensures that JSON files can be reliably used directly by the project management tool, supporting dynamic project workflows.
