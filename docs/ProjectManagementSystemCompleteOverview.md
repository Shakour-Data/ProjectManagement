# Project Management System Complete Overview

## Introduction

The Project Management System is a fully automated, Python-based tool designed to serve as the "brain" of any software project. It manages the entire project lifecycle from an empty project folder, transforming creative user inputs into formal tasks, tracking progress, managing resources, and generating reports and dashboards. The system integrates deeply with GitHub and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to provide seamless automation and real-time project management.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the toolâ€™s architecture, features, usage workflow, and best practices.

## Key Features

- Fully automated project lifecycle management covering planning, execution, monitoring, and closure phases with minimal manual input.
- Deep integration with GitHub for Issues, Projects, Pull Requests, Wikis, and Actions for real-time project updates.
- Interactive chat interface within VS Code for informal, natural language inputs.
- Intelligent parsing of creative inputs into formal tasks with prioritization, scheduling, dependencies, and status tracking.
- Real-time progress tracking based on commit history and automated task updates.
- Automated generation of detailed reports, changelogs, decision logs, and visual dashboards.
- Support for multiple project management methodologies including PMBOK, Scrum, Kanban, and traditional Gantt charts.
- Comprehensive resource allocation, cost, risk, and quality management aligned with PMBOK standards.
- Role-based access control and secure encrypted storage of GitHub authentication tokens.
- Automated backups and recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
- Extensible plugin system for adding new features and integrations.
- Minimal manual input required beyond initial creative task descriptions.

## Architecture and Technology Stack

- Backend: Python core logic handling input parsing, task management, progress calculation, and reporting.
- CLI: Command-line interface for installation, starting automation, and status checks.
- GitHub API: For issue tracking, project boards, pull requests, and CI/CD workflows.
- VS Code Extension API: Provides an interactive chat interface and integrates dashboards.
- Data Storage: JSON files for inputs and outputs, local project files, and GitHub repositories.
- Testing: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests ensure reliability.
- Security: Encrypted token storage and API rate limit compliance.

## Installation and Setup

- The system provides setup scripts to facilitate environment preparation:
  - `scripts/setup_env.sh`: Automates creation of a Python virtual environment, upgrades pip, and installs required packages.
  - `scripts/setup_interactive.py`: Interactive setup script that validates required JSON input files, prompts for human resources data entry, and installs dependencies.

1. Install the tool as a Python package.
2. Automatic creation of a Python virtual environment and dependency installation.
3. Automatic installation of essential VS Code extensions (e.g., BLACKBOX AI).
4. Secure storage of GitHub tokens and project state initialization.
5. Immediate interaction via VS Code chat interface without complex configuration.

## Foundational Workflow

### Starting a New Project

- Every software project begins with an empty folder created by the user.
- The project management package is installed into this folder.
- The user provides essential input data to enable the system to function effectively.

### Critical Inputs

1. Project Start Date: Defines the official start of the project timeline.

2. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) JSON:
   - A 6-level hierarchical JSON structure defining all project tasks.
   - The first 3 levels are common across software projects.
   - The last 3 levels are project-specific, detailing tasks down to the product level.
   - The lowest level (level 6) contains actionable tasks.

3. Human Resources JSON: Defines the human resources available for the project, including roles and attributes.

4. Resource Allocation JSON:
   - Assigns resources specifically to level 6 WBS activities.
   - Resource leveling is performed to optimize resource usage and task scheduling.

---

## Usage Workflow

- Users provide creative inputs (text, code snippets, images) in natural language.
- The tool converts inputs into formal tasks with attributes like priority, dependencies, and deadlines.
- Task statuses synchronize with GitHub Issues and Project boards.
- Automates coding, testing, documentation, and progress tracking.
- Generates daily updated reports and real-time dashboards.
- Sends notifications for stalled tasks, upcoming deadlines, and required reviews.

---

## Processing Workflow

### Input Handling

- The system reads and validates all input JSON files.
- Ensures the WBS is properly structured to 6 levels.
- Loads human resources and resource allocation data.

### Task and Resource Management

- Parses the WBS and resource data to build an internal task and resource model.
- Performs resource leveling based on dependencies and allocations.
- Calculates task start and end dates accordingly.

### Progress Tracking

- Integrates with Git to analyze commit history.
- Maps commits to tasks using commit messages and file changes.
- Calculates progress based on commit data and workflow stage completion.
- Computes dynamic importance and urgency scores for tasks based on deadlines, dependencies, and priorities.

### Automation and Integration

- Automates Git commit and push operations with meaningful commit messages.
- Synchronizes task statuses with GitHub Issues and Project boards.
- Provides an interactive VS Code chat interface for natural language task management.
- Generates daily updated reports, changelogs, decision logs, and visual dashboards.

## Outputs

### JSON Files

- commit_task_database.json: Maps Git commits to tasks with detailed metadata. Used for audit trails, progress tracking, and reporting.

- commit_progress.json: Summarizes progress ratios per task group. Used by progress calculators and reporting modules.

- Other JSON files: Include enriched WBS data, resource allocations, workflow definitions, and scoring data.

### Reports and Dashboards

- Markdown reports on task progress, priority, and urgency.
- Visual dashboards accessible within VS Code and GitHub.
- Archived historical reports for tracking project evolution.

### Git Commits

- Automated commits with conventional commit messages linked to tasks.
- Pushes to remote repositories to maintain synchronization.

---

## Progress Calculation

- Combines commit-based progress (analyzing git commit messages) and workflow-based progress (completion of workflow steps).
- Calculates dynamic importance and urgency scores for tasks based on deadlines, dependencies, priority, and status.
- Enriches tasks with progress and scoring for prioritization and reporting.

---

## Reporting and Dashboards

- Generates reports on top important and urgent tasks.
- Categorizes tasks using the Eisenhower matrix.
- Saves reports and dashboards as markdown files in designated directories.
- Archives previous reports for historical tracking.

---

## Security and Backup

- Secure handling and encrypted storage of GitHub authentication tokens.
- Role-based access control for multi-user projects.
- Automated backups of project state and documentation.
- Recovery mechanisms to handle data loss or corruption.

---

## Extensibility

- Plugin architecture allows adding new features and integrations.
- Extensive use of GitHub Actions and internal bots for automation and notifications.
