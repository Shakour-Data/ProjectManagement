# General Instructions for Designing JSON Resource Files to Create Database Tables

This document provides a comprehensive, standardized guideline for creating JSON resource files that can be used to automatically create and populate database tables, specifically focusing on resource management such as human resources. The instructions are aligned with best practices in project management and database design.

---

## 1. Purpose

To define a clear and consistent approach for structuring JSON resource files so they can be directly mapped to database tables, enabling automation in data import, validation, and management.

---

## 2. JSON Structure Principles

- Each JSON object corresponds to a single row in the database table.
- JSON keys must exactly match the database column names for seamless mapping.
- Data types in JSON should align with the database schema (e.g., string, integer, float).
- Avoid deeply nested objects; use flat structures or related tables for hierarchical data.

---

## 3. Key Elements for Resource JSON Files

- **Unique Identifier**: Each resource entry must have a unique ID (e.g., `id` or `resource_id`).
- **Descriptive Fields**: Include fields such as `name`, `role`, `department`, `contact_info`, etc.
- **Data Types**: Use appropriate data types:
  - Strings for names, roles, contact details.
  - Integers for IDs, numeric codes.
  - Booleans for flags (e.g., active/inactive).
  - Dates in ISO 8601 format for hire dates, contract dates.
- **Optional Fields**: Allow for optional fields but document them clearly.

## 4. Example JSON Schema for Human Resources Table

```json
[
  {
    "id": "HR001",
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "role": "Project Manager",
    "department": "Management",
    "email": "alice.johnson@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "hire_date": "2022-01-15",
    "active": true,
    "github_address": "https://github.com/alicejohnson",
    "gmail": "alice.johnson@gmail.com",
    "gmail_password": "encrypted_password_here",
    "github_password": "encrypted_password_here",
    "github_token": "ghp_exampletoken1234567890"
  },
  {
    "id": "HR002",
    "name": "Bob Smith",
    "role": "Developer",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "email": "bob.smith@example.com",
    "phone": "+0987654321",
    "hire_date": "2023-03-01",
    "active": true,
    "github_address": "https://github.com/bobsmith",
    "gmail": "bob.smith@gmail.com",
    "gmail_password": "encrypted_password_here",
    "github_password": "encrypted_password_here",
    "github_token": "ghp_exampletoken0987654321"
  }
]
```

## 5. Database Table Schema Correspondence

| Column Name      | Data Type | Description                      |
|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| id               | TEXT      | Unique resource identifier      |
| name             | TEXT      | Full name of the resource       |
| role             | TEXT      | Job title or role               |
| department       | TEXT      | Department or team              |
| email            | TEXT      | Contact email address           |
| phone            | TEXT      | Contact phone number            |
| hire_date        | DATE      | Date of hire or contract start |
| active           | BOOLEAN   | Employment status               |
| github_address   | TEXT      | GitHub profile URL              |
| gmail            | TEXT      | Gmail address                  |
| gmail_password   | TEXT      | Encrypted Gmail password        |
| github_password  | TEXT      | Encrypted GitHub password       |
| github_token     | TEXT      | GitHub personal access token    |

## 6. Validation and Automation

- Validate JSON files against the schema before importing.
- Use automated scripts or ETL tools to parse JSON and insert/update database tables.
- Maintain version control for JSON files to track changes and enable rollback.
- Schedule regular synchronization between JSON resources and database tables.

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Keep JSON files well-formatted and human-readable.
- Use consistent naming conventions for keys and database columns.
- Document the JSON schema and database mapping clearly.
- Handle missing or optional fields gracefully in the database.
- For large datasets, consider batch processing and incremental updates.

---

## 8. Summary

Following these instructions ensures that JSON resource files for human resources or other resource types are designed to be compatible with database tables, enabling efficient automation and reliable project resource management.
