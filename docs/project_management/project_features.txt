   - Automatically install necessary VS Code extensions such as BLACKBOX AI and others to enhance the development environment.

2. GitHub Integration:
   - Full integration with GitHub Issues, Projects, Pull Requests, and Wikis.
   - Automatic creation, updating, and closing of GitHub Issues based on task status.
   - Synchronization with GitHub Project boards to reflect task progress.
   - Linking tasks to Pull Requests and updating statuses based on PR reviews and merges.
   - Optionally, use GitHub Actions for workflow automation and notifications.

3. Task Management:
   - Automatic parsing of user-provided creative inputs into formal tasks.
   - Intelligent task prioritization based on deadlines, dependencies, and importance.
   - Task scheduling suggestions and automatic deadline reminders.
   - Support for task dependencies and conflict detection.
   - Multi-project and multi-user task assignment and tracking.

4. Documentation and SOP Management:
   - Maintain Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and project documentation in markdown or text files within the repo.
   - Automatic versioning and updating of documentation as project evolves.
   - Generation of changelogs and decision logs.
   - Integration with GitHub Wiki for extended documentation.

5. Progress Tracking and Reporting:
   - Real-time tracking of task completion, ongoing work, and pending items.
   - Automated generation of progress reports and analytics.
   - Visual summaries or dashboards (e.g., markdown reports) stored in the repo.
   - Notifications for stalled tasks, upcoming deadlines, and required reviews.

6. Communication and Feedback:
   - Use GitHub issue comments, pull request reviews, and chat (VS Code chat) for communication.
   - Automated summaries of progress and next steps sent regularly.
   - Feedback loops integrated into task and PR workflows.

7. Automation and Extensibility:
   - Use GitHub Actions or internal bots to automate repetitive workflows.
   - Plugin or extension system to add new features or integrate with other tools.
   - Minimal manual input required from users beyond creative task descriptions.

8. Security and Permissions:
   - Secure handling of GitHub authentication tokens.
   - Role-based access control if multiple users are involved.
   - Compliance with GitHub API rate limits and best practices.

9. Usability:
   - Simple CLI commands for setup, status checks, task updates, and report generation.
   - Clear error handling and user guidance.
   - Comprehensive logging for audit and troubleshooting.

10. Backup and Recovery:
    - Automatic backups of project management state and documentation.
    - Recovery mechanisms in case of data loss or corruption.

11. Project Management Standards Integration:
    - Full compliance with PMBOK standards including resource management, cost management, risk management, and quality management.
    - Detailed resource allocation and management features, including tracking availability, utilization, and skill sets.
    - Comprehensive cost management capabilities covering budgeting, expense tracking, and cost forecasting.
    - Support for Agile methodologies with Scrum framework implementation including ceremonies, roles, and artifacts.
    - Kanban boards for visual task management and workflow optimization.
    - Integration of Gantt charts and traditional project management methods alongside Agile features.
    - Support for multi-method project management allowing users to switch or combine methodologies as needed.

Usage Workflow:
---------------
- Install the tool at the start of the project.
- Initialize the project management state.
- Provide creative task inputs informally via VS Code chat.
- The tool automatically converts inputs into formal tasks and manages them on GitHub.
- Progress is tracked and updated automatically.
- Regular reports and notifications keep collaborators informed.
- Feedback and adjustments are handled seamlessly through GitHub and chat.

Task Breakdown and Workflow:
----------------------------
- The project schedule will be divided into at least 6 hierarchical levels.
- Each level will be further subdivided into at least 4 sections, up to 6 levels deep.
- The lowest level will represent individual tasks.
- A complete workflow will be executed for each task to consider it done, including coding, testing, documentation, and review.
- This hierarchical breakdown ensures detailed tracking and management of all project activities.

Conclusion:
-----------
This tool is designed to be the ultimate project management assistant for software projects, ensuring that collaboration is smooth, transparent, and efficient. It leverages GitHub's free features extensively and automates as much as possible to let users focus on creative and critical work without worrying about administrative overhead.

Note on Creative Inputs:
- The tool will support various types of creative inputs including text files, code snippets, and images.
- It will provide mechanisms to process, store, and manage these diverse input types effectively within the project workflow.

12. Automation and Workflow Continuity:
    - The tool will automate nearly all aspects of project management including coding, testing, documentation, and task tracking.
    - Users will interact primarily through an informal chat interface within VS Code, providing text, code snippets, or other inputs in a natural, unstructured manner.
    - The system will continuously interpret these inputs, converting them into formal tasks, code implementations, tests, and project management actions.
    - Deep integration with GitHub will facilitate automated version control, issue tracking, pull request management, and CI/CD workflows.
    - All commits will be performed automatically, and project progress will be calculated based on commit history.
    - Git operations and project management reports will be fully synchronized.
    - The tool will dynamically utilize GitHub Actions for automation.
    - Project management reports will be updated daily.
    - Various dashboards will be available to show real-time project status.
    - Output formats will be flexible, including text files, markdown, or native GitHub features.
    - The automation will be seamless and continuous, enabling the tool to manage and complete an entire software project lifecycle with minimal manual intervention.
    - The goal is to allow users to focus on creative and critical thinking while the tool handles the operational and administrative overhead.
    - The tool will fully leverage all free features and extensions of VS Code, including BLACKBOX AI, to enhance productivity and automation.
