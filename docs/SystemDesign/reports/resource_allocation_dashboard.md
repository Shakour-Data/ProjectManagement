# Resource Allocation Dashboard

## Overview
The Resource Allocation Dashboard provides an overview of resource usage and availability, helping project managers identify over-allocated or underutilized resources. It supports monitoring both human and material resources across tasks and project phases.

## Purpose
- To monitor resource assignments and utilization.
- To identify resource conflicts and imbalances.
- To optimize resource allocation for project efficiency.

## Key Features and Metrics
- **Resource Usage Overview:** Displays current allocation of human and material resources.
- **Availability Tracking:** Shows resource availability and potential conflicts.
- **Utilization Rates:** Measures workload balance and resource efficiency.
- **Conflict Identification:** Highlights over-allocated or underutilized resources.

## Data Sources
- Resource metadata and allocation data from project JSON inputs.
- Task assignments and schedules.

## UI/UX Considerations
- Visual charts showing resource allocation and availability.
- Filters by resource type, project phase, and task.
- Alerts for resource conflicts and over-allocation.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

## Implementation Details
- Backend modules to aggregate resource allocation data.
- APIs to serve resource utilization metrics.
- Frontend components with interactive charts and alerts.
- Integration with project management system for real-time updates.

## Testing and Validation
- Unit tests for data aggregation and conflict detection.
- UI tests for chart accuracy and interactivity.
- Performance testing for real-time data updates.

## Next Steps
- Define resource data schema and allocation rules.
- Develop backend aggregation and conflict detection logic.
- Design and implement frontend visualization components.
- Plan integration and testing phases.
