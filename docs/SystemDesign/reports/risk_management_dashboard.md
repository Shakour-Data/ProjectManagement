# Risk Management Dashboard

## Overview
The Risk Management Dashboard tracks identified project risks and their mitigation status. It provides visual heatmaps of risk impact and probability, and helps project managers monitor and manage risks effectively.

## Purpose
- To provide visibility into project risks and issues.
- To track risk status, impact, and mitigation plans.
- To notify stakeholders of critical risks.

## Key Features and Metrics
- **Risk Register:** List of identified risks with descriptions and statuses.
- **Impact and Probability Heatmaps:** Visual representation of risk severity.
- **Mitigation Status:** Tracking of risk mitigation actions and progress.
- **Notifications:** Alerts for high-impact or unresolved risks.

## Data Sources
- Risk metadata and status from project JSON inputs.
- Task and issue tracking data related to risks.

## UI/UX Considerations
- Interactive heatmaps with drill-down capabilities.
- Clear risk status indicators and color coding.
- Responsive design for various devices.
- Notification system integration.

## Implementation Details
- Backend modules to aggregate and update risk data.
- APIs to provide risk metrics and statuses.
- Frontend components for heatmaps and risk lists.
- Integration with alert and notification systems.

## Testing and Validation
- Unit tests for risk data processing.
- UI tests for heatmap rendering and interactivity.
- Notification system testing.

## Next Steps
- Define risk data schema and tracking methods.
- Develop backend aggregation and API endpoints.
- Design frontend heatmap and risk list components.
- Implement notification and alert features.
