|------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| detailed_wbs.json             | User Input           | Created/edited by users defining WBS      | Used by task management, progress tracking |
| human_resources.json          | User Input           | Created/edited by users defining resources| Used by resource allocation, scheduling    |
| wbs_data.json                | System/User Input    | Parsed from detailed WBS or imported      | Used by task import, database updates      |
| wbs_scores.json              | System Generated     | Calculated importance/urgency scores      | Used by prioritization, reporting          |

## Additional Detailed Documentation

For more detailed and precise documentation on critical JSON files, please refer to the following documents:

- [commit_task_database.json Standard](./commit_task_database.md)
- [Detailed JSON Workflow and Documentation Process](./json_workflow_detailed.md)
- [workflow_definition.json Standard](./workflow_definition_detailed.md)
- **Data Source:** Provided and maintained by users to define the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
- **Formation:** Users create or edit this file to specify tasks, subtasks, durations, and dependencies.
- **Usage:** Consumed by task management modules, progress calculators, and reporting tools.
- **Relationships:** Serves as the base structure for wbs_data.json and influences resource allocation files.

### human_resources.json
- **Data Source:** User-maintained list of human resources with attributes.
- **Formation:** Created and updated by project managers or HR personnel.
- **Usage:** Used by resource allocation and leveling modules to assign resources to tasks.
- **Relationships:** Linked with resource_allocation.json and task_resource_allocation.json.

### wbs_data.json
- **Data Source:** Derived from detailed_wbs.json or imported from external sources.
- **Formation:** Created by parsing detailed_wbs.json or through import modules.
- **Usage:** Used for database updates, task imports, and progress tracking.
- **Relationships:** Reflects the WBS structure and is linked to wbs_scores.json for prioritization.

### wbs_scores.json
- **Data Source:** System-generated based on task importance and urgency calculations.
- **Formation:** Calculated by importance_urgency_calculator and related modules.
- **Usage:** Used to prioritize tasks in reporting and scheduling.
- **Relationships:** Depends on wbs_data.json and influences task prioritization.

### resource_allocation.json & task_resource_allocation.json
- **Data Source:** User-defined resource assignments to tasks.
- **Formation:** Created by project managers to allocate resources.
- **Usage:** Used by resource leveling and task execution modules.
- **Relationships:** Linked to human_resources.json and detailed_wbs.json.

### workflow_definition.json
- **Data Source:** User-defined workflow stages and weights.
- **Formation:** Created to define the lifecycle stages of tasks.
- **Usage:** Used by progress tracking, reporting, and automation modules.
- **Relationships:** Influences commit_progress.json and progress calculations.

### commit_progress.json
- **Data Source:** System-generated by auto_commit module tracking commit progress.
- **Formation:** Generated by analyzing git changes and commit history.
- **Usage:** Used by progress_calculator and reporting modules to monitor project progress.
- **Relationships:** Reflects progress on tasks defined in detailed_wbs.json and workflow_definition.json.

### commit_task_database.json
- **Data Source:** System-generated mapping commits to tasks with metadata.
- **Formation:** Updated by auto_commit module with commit hashes, messages, and task associations.
- **Usage:** Used for audit trails, reporting, and traceability.
- **Relationships:** Linked to commit_progress.json and task definitions.

- Users provide input JSON files defining project structure, resources, and workflows.
- System modules parse and generate derived JSON files for task management and scoring.
- Auto_commit module tracks commit progress and updates progress-related JSON files.
- Reporting modules consume progress and task data for dashboards and reports.
