# Detailed Workflow Definitions for Software Projects

This document defines a comprehensive and standardized set of workflow stages for software projects. Each stage includes a progress weight, rationale for its inclusion, tasks to be performed, and guidance on how to execute those tasks effectively. The progress weights are designed to provide a reasonable and balanced measure of overall project progress.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Requirements Gathering
- **Weight:** 0.15
- **Rationale:** Understanding and documenting what the software must achieve is critical to project success.
- **Tasks:**
  - Engage stakeholders to collect requirements.
  - Document functional and non-functional requirements.
  - Validate requirements with stakeholders.
- **How to Perform:**
  - Conduct interviews, surveys, and workshops.
  - Use requirement management tools or documents.
  - Review and get sign-off from stakeholders.

### 2. Design
- **Weight:** 0.15
- **Rationale:** A well-thought-out design ensures the system architecture supports requirements and is maintainable.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create system architecture diagrams.
  - Define data models and interfaces.
  - Plan for scalability, security, and performance.
- **How to Perform:**
  - Use UML or other modeling tools.
  - Collaborate with architects and senior developers.
  - Review design documents with the team.

### 3. Implementation
- **Weight:** 0.30
- **Rationale:** Actual coding transforms designs into working software.
- **Tasks:**
  - Develop features according to design.
  - Write unit and integration tests.
  - Perform code reviews.
- **How to Perform:**
  - Follow coding standards and best practices.
  - Use version control systems.
  - Continuously integrate and test code.

### 4. Code Review
- **Weight:** 0.10
- **Rationale:** Ensures code quality, consistency, and knowledge sharing.
- **Tasks:**
  - Review code for correctness and style.
  - Provide constructive feedback.
  - Approve or request changes.
- **How to Perform:**
  - Use code review tools (e.g., GitHub PRs).
  - Follow a checklist for reviews.
  - Engage multiple reviewers if possible.

### 5. Testing
- **Weight:** 0.15
- **Rationale:** Validates that the software meets requirements and is free of critical defects.
- **Tasks:**
  - Perform functional, regression, and performance testing.
  - Log and track defects.
  - Verify fixes and retest.
- **How to Perform:**
  - Use automated and manual testing techniques.
  - Employ test management tools.
  - Collaborate with QA teams.

### 6. Deployment
- **Weight:** 0.10
- **Rationale:** Delivering the software to production or end-users is essential for value realization.
- **Tasks:**
  - Prepare deployment scripts and documentation.
  - Execute deployment in staging and production.
  - Monitor deployment success and rollback if needed.
- **How to Perform:**
  - Use CI/CD pipelines.
  - Follow deployment checklists.
  - Communicate with stakeholders.

### 7. Maintenance
- **Weight:** 0.05
- **Rationale:** Ongoing support and improvements ensure software longevity and user satisfaction.
- **Tasks:**
  - Monitor system performance and errors.
  - Apply patches and updates.
  - Plan for future enhancements.
- **How to Perform:**
  - Use monitoring and alerting tools.
  - Maintain documentation.
  - Engage with user feedback.
