# Detailed Workflow for JSON File Usage in Software Projects

This document describes a comprehensive workflow for managing JSON files in software projects, covering the entire lifecycle from creation to maintenance, including inline and external documentation practices.

---

## 1. JSON File Creation and Input

- Users or developers create initial JSON input files defining project data such as:
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
  - Human Resources
  - Resource Allocation
  - Workflow Definitions
  - Task Scores

- These files are stored in designated input directories.

- JSON files must conform to documented standards specifying structure, fields, and data types.

---

## 2. System Processing and JSON Generation

- Software modules read input JSON files to perform computations, updates, and generate output JSON files.

- Modules should include clear documentation on:
  - Expected JSON file formats.
  - Data dependencies and flow between JSON files.
  - Validation and error handling.

- Output JSON files are stored separately from inputs to maintain data integrity.

---

## 3. Inline Code Documentation

- Developers should include inline comments and docstrings in code modules to document:
  - JSON file usage and expected formats.
  - Data processing logic involving JSON files.
  - Any assumptions or constraints related to JSON data.

- Inline documentation facilitates code maintenance and onboarding.

---

## 4. External Documentation

- Maintain comprehensive external documentation in markdown or similar formats covering:
  - JSON file standards and schemas.
  - Usage guidelines and best practices.
  - Examples and sample data.
  - References to code modules interacting with JSON files.

- Keep external docs updated alongside code changes.

---

## 5. Validation and Testing

- Implement validation mechanisms to ensure JSON files conform to standards before processing.

- Testing should cover:
  - JSON file correctness and completeness.
  - Module functionality with various JSON inputs.
  - Integration testing of JSON data flow across modules.

---

## 6. Maintenance and Updates

- Regularly review and update JSON standards and documentation.

- Use version control to track changes in JSON files and related documentation.

- Encourage collaboration between developers and documentation writers.

---

## Summary

This workflow provides a robust framework for managing JSON files in software projects, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and quality throughout the project lifecycle.
