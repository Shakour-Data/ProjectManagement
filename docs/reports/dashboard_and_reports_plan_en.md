# Combined Dashboard and Reports Plan for Project Management Tool

_Last updated: 2025-07-25_

## Overview
This document outlines the key dashboards and reports that should be developed for the project management tool. It includes both a detailed plan for implementation and a blueprint describing the purpose, key information displayed, and implementation notes for each dashboard and report. It also covers the integration of related tasks into the main project workflow.

---

## Dashboards to be Developed

1. **Progress Dashboard / Progress Report Dashboard**
   - Real-time visualization of project progress
   - Task completion rates, milestones achieved
   - Burn-down and burn-up charts
   - Scrum-specific views: sprint burndown, velocity charts, sprint backlog
   - Overall project completion percentage
   - Breakdown of tasks by status: completed, in progress, pending
   - Progress by WBS levels or project phases
   - Visual charts (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs)
   - Implementation Notes: Aggregate task statuses from JSON inputs and update dynamically

2. **Importance and Urgency Dashboard / Task Priority and Urgency Dashboard**
   - Visualization of tasks based on Eisenhower matrix
   - Highlight critical tasks that are both important and urgent
   - Filter and search capabilities by project phase, assignee, etc.
   - Lists of top priority and urgent tasks
   - Alerts for overdue or high-risk tasks
   - Implementation Notes: Use task attributes to generate sorted lists and matrix

3. **Resource Allocation Dashboard**
   - Overview of resource usage and availability
   - Identification of over-allocated or underutilized resources
   - Human and material resource allocation per task
   - Resource availability and conflicts
   - Utilization rates and workload balance
   - Implementation Notes: Integrate resource JSON files and allocation data

4. **Risk Management Dashboard / Risk and Issue Tracking Dashboard**
   - Tracking identified risks and mitigation status
   - Risk impact and probability heatmaps
   - List of identified risks and issues
   - Status, impact, and mitigation plans
   - Notifications for critical risks
   - Implementation Notes: Track risk data and integrate with task statuses

5. **Cost Management Dashboard**
   - Budget vs actual expenditure tracking
   - Forecasting and variance analysis
   - Cost breakdown by task or phase
   - Implementation Notes: Use cost-related JSON inputs and update regularly

---

## Reports to be Developed

1. **Importance and Urgency Report**
   - Detailed list of tasks categorized by importance and urgency
   - Includes task metadata, status, and workflow position

2. **Progress Report / Detailed Task Progress Report**
   - Summary of completed, in-progress, and pending tasks
   - Milestone achievement and delays
   - Scrum reports: sprint review, retrospective summaries, velocity reports
   - Comprehensive report on task statuses, progress percentages, and deadlines
   - Contents include task list with status, assigned users, deadlines, progress trends over time, and summary of delayed or stalled tasks
   - Implementation: Extract from task JSON and update with progress tracking

3. **Resource Utilization Report**
   - Detailed resource usage statistics
   - Recommendations for reallocation
   - Analysis of resource usage and availability
   - Contents include resource allocation per task, utilization percentages, over-allocated or under-utilized resources
   - Implementation: Use resource and allocation JSON files

4. **Risk Report / Risk and Issue Report**
   - Comprehensive risk register
   - Status and action plans
   - Summary of project risks and their management status
   - Contents include risk descriptions, impact, probability, mitigation actions, progress, open issues, and resolutions
   - Implementation: Track risk and issue JSON data

5. **Cost Report / Cost Analysis Report**
   - Detailed financial report on project costs
   - Financial overview of project costs
   - Contents include budget adherence, expense tracking, forecasts, and cost variances
   - Implementation: Aggregate cost data from inputs

6. **GitHub Synchronization Report**
   - Status of GitHub integration and task synchronization
   - Contents include open and closed issues linked to tasks, pull request statuses, automated changelogs, and audit trails
   - Implementation: Use GitHub API data and synchronization logs

---

## Implementation Plan

- Develop JSON structure for Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) if not already present
- Implement parsers to convert project plans into WBS JSON
- Develop modules for calculating task metrics (importance, urgency, progress)
- Create report generation scripts for each report type
- Develop dashboard UI components integrated with backend data
- Add tasks for dashboard and report development into main project task management system
- Implement automated testing for dashboards and reports
- Develop SQLite database to store all report and dashboard data centrally
- Add task for creating and integrating SQLite database into main project workflow

---

## Next Steps

- Verify existence and completeness of WBS JSON file
- Prioritize dashboard and report development tasks
- Begin coding and integration as per plan

This combined document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development of dashboards and reports in the project management tool.
