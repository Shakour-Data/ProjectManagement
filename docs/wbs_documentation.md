# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Documentation

## Overview

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the project into smaller, more manageable components or tasks. It enables clear organization, assignment, and tracking of work items throughout the project lifecycle.

## WBS in the Project Management Tool

The project management tool supports automated generation and management of the WBS using AI-assisted parsing of creative inputs. The WBS is represented as a hierarchy of tasks with parent-child relationships, allowing for multiple levels of decomposition.

## Hierarchical Task Structure

- Each task is represented by a `Task` object with attributes including:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the task.
  - `title`: Brief title or name of the task.
  - `description`: Detailed description (optional).
  - `deadline`: Optional due date.
  - `dependencies`: List of task IDs this task depends on.
  - `assigned_to`: List of users assigned to the task.
  - `status`: Current status (e.g., pending, in_progress, completed).
  - `priority`: Numeric priority value.
  - `parent_id`: ID of the parent task (None if top-level).

- Tasks can have multiple levels of subtasks, enabling deep hierarchical breakdowns (e.g., 5 levels or more).

## Automated WBS Generation

- The tool includes a method `generate_wbs_from_idea(input_text)` that takes a creative idea or project description as input.
- This method generates a hierarchical WBS with multiple levels of tasks and subtasks.
- Currently, this is a placeholder implementation that creates a sample 3-level WBS.
- Future integration with BLACKBOX AI or other NLP tools will enable intelligent parsing and decomposition of project ideas into detailed WBS automatically.

## Benefits

- Enables clear visualization and management of complex projects.
- Facilitates task assignment, scheduling, and progress tracking at granular levels.
- Supports automated workflows and reporting based on task hierarchies.

## Example

Given an input idea "Develop Project Management Tool", the generated WBS might include:

- Develop Project Management Tool (root task)
  - Subtask Level 1.1
    - Subtask Level 2.1.1
    - Subtask Level 2.1.2
  - Subtask Level 1.2
    - Subtask Level 2.2.1
    - Subtask Level 2.2.2
  - Subtask Level 1.3
    - Subtask Level 2.3.1
    - Subtask Level 2.3.2

## Next Steps

- Enhance the WBS generation method with AI-powered parsing.
- Integrate WBS visualization in dashboards and reports.
- Enable editing and management of hierarchical tasks through the user interface.
