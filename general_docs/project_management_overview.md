## Usage Workflow

- Users provide creative inputs (text, code snippets, images) in natural language.
- The tool converts inputs into formal tasks with attributes like priority, dependencies, and deadlines.
- Task statuses synchronize with GitHub Issues and Project boards.
- Automates coding, testing, documentation, and progress tracking.
- Generates daily updated reports and real-time dashboards.
- Sends notifications for stalled tasks, upcoming deadlines, and required reviews.

## Input Data and File Structure

- **PM_Input Directory:** Contains JSON files such as `detailed_wbs.json`, `workflow_definition.json`, `commit_progress.json`, and others.
- **Task Attributes:** Include id, title, description, deadline, dependencies, assigned users, status, priority, and progress.
- **Resource Allocation:** Managed via JSON files linking resources to tasks with allocation percentages and roles.

## Progress Calculation

- Combines commit-based progress (analyzing git commit messages) and workflow-based progress (completion of workflow steps).
- Calculates dynamic importance and urgency scores for tasks based on deadlines, dependencies, priority, and status.
- Enriches tasks with progress and scoring for prioritization and reporting.

---

## Reporting and Dashboards

- Generates reports on top important and urgent tasks.
- Categorizes tasks using the Eisenhower matrix.
- Saves reports and dashboards as markdown files in designated directories.
- Archives previous reports for historical tracking.

---

## Security and Backup

- Secure handling and encrypted storage of GitHub authentication tokens.
- Role-based access control for multi-user projects.
- Automated backups of project state and documentation.
- Recovery mechanisms to handle data loss or corruption.

---

## Extensibility

- Plugin architecture allows adding new features and integrations.
- Extensive use of GitHub Actions and internal bots for automation and notifications.
