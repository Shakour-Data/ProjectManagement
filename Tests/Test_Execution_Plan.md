- Review the Documentation and Usability Testing documentation in `Tests/TestingDocs/Documentation_Usability_Testing.md`.
- Test documentation accuracy and usability in `Tests/TestingCode/DocumentationUsabilityTests`.
- Evaluate user interface and accessibility.
- Update Documentation and Usability Testing documentation.

### Step 10: Shell Integration and Terminal Testing

- Complete the README.md file in `Tests/TestingCode/ShellIntegrationTerminalTests` with detailed activities and test cases.
- Review the Shell Integration and Terminal Testing documentation in `Tests/TestingDocs/Shell_Integration_Terminal_Testing.md`.
- Perform shell and terminal tests in `Tests/TestingCode/ShellIntegrationTerminalTests`.
- Verify terminal behavior and shell compatibility.
- Log results and update the Shell Integration and Terminal Testing checklist.

### Step 11: Environment Setup

- Set up the testing environment:
  - Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
  - Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  - Verify access to all test code directories.

## Reporting and Continuous Improvement

- After each test phase, use the update script to refresh test documentation with pass/fail status and timestamps.
- Review failures and coordinate fixes.
- Repeat testing cycles until all tests pass.
