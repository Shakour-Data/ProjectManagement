## Overview

Regression testing ensures that recent changes or bug fixes have not adversely affected existing functionality. It is critical for maintaining software stability over time.

---

## Testing Strategy

- Re-run existing unit, integration, and system tests after code changes.
- Automate regression tests where possible.
- Focus on areas impacted by recent changes.
- Maintain a regression test suite that grows with the project.

---

## Test Categories and Cases

### 1. Test Re-Execution

- Re-run all relevant unit tests.
- Re-run integration tests for affected modules.
- Execute system tests covering impacted workflows.
- Verify bug fixes do not introduce new issues.

### 2. Compatibility Testing

- Test backward compatibility with previous versions.
- Verify data migration and upgrade paths.
