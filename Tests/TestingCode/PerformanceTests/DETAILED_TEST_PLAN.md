# Detailed Performance Testing Plan

_Last updated: 2025-07-27_

---

## Objective

To evaluate the system's responsiveness, stability, scalability, and resource usage under various conditions.

---

## Activities

- Design performance test scenarios simulating expected and peak loads.
- Measure response times, throughput, and resource consumption.
- Identify bottlenecks and performance issues.
- Automate performance test execution where possible.
- Document results and recommend optimizations.

---

## Test Cases

- Load testing with increasing user or data volume.
- Stress testing beyond normal operational capacity.
- Endurance testing for prolonged operation.
- Resource utilization monitoring.

---

## Execution Steps

1. Set up performance test environment.
2. Execute performance test scenarios.
3. Analyze performance metrics and identify issues.
4. Update performance testing documentation.
5. Repeat tests after optimizations.
