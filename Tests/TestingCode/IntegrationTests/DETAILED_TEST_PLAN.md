_Last updated: 2025-07-27_

---

## Objective

To verify that integrated modules and components interact correctly, ensuring data flow and control flow between units function as intended.

---

## Activities

- Develop integration tests covering interactions between key modules.
- Test data exchange, API calls, and interface contracts.
- Include tests for normal operation, error propagation, and boundary conditions.
- Automate test execution and maintain test scripts.
- Record and analyze test results, updating documentation accordingly.

---

## Test Cases

- Module-to-module communication tests.
- API endpoint integration tests.
- Data consistency and synchronization tests.
- Error handling across module boundaries.

---

## Execution Steps

1. Prepare the integrated environment.
2. Run integration test suites.
3. Investigate and resolve any failures.
4. Update integration test documentation and checklists.
5. Repeat testing until all tests pass.
