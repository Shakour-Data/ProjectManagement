# Detailed Unit Testing Plan

_Last updated: 2025-07-27_

---

## Objective

To verify the correctness of individual components, functions, and methods in isolation, ensuring they behave as expected under various conditions.

---

## Activities

- Develop unit tests covering all core functions and classes in both `main_modules` and `services` directories.
- Include tests for normal cases, boundary conditions, error handling, and edge cases.
- Use automated test runners (e.g., pytest, unittest) to execute tests frequently.
- Maintain and update tests as code evolves.
- Record test results and update documentation after each run.
- Organize test files mirroring the source code folder structure for clarity (`test_main_modules`, `test_services`).

---

## Test Cases

- Function input validation tests.
- Output correctness tests.
- Exception and error handling tests.
- Performance of critical functions (if applicable).
- Integration points within modules where applicable.

---

## Execution Steps

1. Set up the test environment with virtual environment and dependencies.
2. Run all unit tests using the test runner.
3. Analyze test results and fix any failures.
4. Update test documentation and checklists.
5. Repeat until all tests pass.
6. After successful runs, update `DETAILED_TEST_PLAN.md` and `README.md` accordingly.
