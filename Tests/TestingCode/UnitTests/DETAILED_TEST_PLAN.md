# Detailed Unit Testing Plan

_Last updated: 2025-07-27_

---

## Objective

To verify the correctness of individual components, functions, and methods in isolation, ensuring they behave as expected under various conditions.

---

## Activities

- Develop unit tests covering all core functions and classes.
- Include tests for normal cases, boundary conditions, and error handling.
- Use automated test runners to execute tests frequently.
- Maintain and update tests as code evolves.
- Record test results and update documentation after each run.

---

## Test Cases

- Function input validation tests.
- Output correctness tests.
- Exception and error handling tests.
- Performance of critical functions (if applicable).

---

## Execution Steps

1. Set up the test environment.
2. Run all unit tests using the test runner.
3. Analyze test results and fix any failures.
4. Update test documentation and checklists.
5. Repeat until all tests pass.
