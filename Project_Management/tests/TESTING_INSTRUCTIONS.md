# Testing Instructions for Project Management Tool

## Overview
This document provides detailed instructions and guidelines for testing the Project Management Tool. It covers various testing levels, critical areas to focus on, and recommended testing strategies to ensure the quality and reliability of the system.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Critical-Path Testing
- Focus on key functionalities that are essential for the tool's operation.
- Verify core features such as task creation, progress calculation, GitHub integration, and report generation.
- Ensure that the system handles typical user workflows without errors.

### 2. Thorough Testing
- Comprehensive testing covering all features, edge cases, and error handling.
- Includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- Validate all dashboards and reports for accuracy and completeness.
- Test synchronization between local data, GitHub, and database.
- Perform performance and stress testing to assess system robustness.

## Areas to Test

### Backend / API
- Task management APIs: creation, update, deletion, and retrieval.
- Progress calculation logic combining commit history and workflow status.
- GitHub integration: issue syncing, project board updates, pull request linking.
- Database operations: data insertion, updates, queries, and integrity.
- Report generation modules: correctness of data aggregation and Markdown output.
- Database queries and views used in report generation classes.

### Frontend / UI (if applicable)
- Dashboard rendering and interactivity.
- Navigation and user input handling.
- Real-time updates and notifications.

### Automated Tests
- Review and run existing unit and integration tests in the `tests/` directory.
- Add new tests for recently implemented features, especially report generation and database interactions.
- Ensure tests cover both typical and edge case scenarios.

## Testing Recommendations

- Use mock data and test databases to isolate test cases.
- Automate tests using a testing framework compatible with the project (e.g., pytest).
- Regularly run tests during development to catch regressions early.
- Document test cases and results for future reference.

## Next Steps

- Update and expand test cases to cover new report generation classes using database queries.
- Implement tests for synchronization mechanisms with GitHub.
- Perform manual exploratory testing to identify usability issues.
- Continuously improve test coverage and quality based on feedback and bug reports.
