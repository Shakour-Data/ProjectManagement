# Project Management Package - Comprehensive Test Checklist

This checklist covers all critical and detailed tests to ensure the Project_Management package functions correctly without errors or warnings.

## 1. JSON Input Files
- [x] Validate presence and correctness of all required input JSON files:
  - detailed_wbs.json
  - task_resource_allocation.json
  - human_resources.json
  - resource_allocation.json
  - wbs_data.json
  - wbs_scores.json
  - workflow_definition.json
- [x] Validate JSON schema and data types for each input file.
- [x] Verify inter-file references and consistency.

## 2. Intermediate JSON Files
- [x] Verify generation of intermediate JSON files linking inputs:
  - linked_wbs_resources.json
- [ ] Validate data correctness and completeness in intermediate files.

## 3. Output JSON Files
- [x] Verify generation of output JSON files:
  - commit_task_database.json
  - commit_progress.json
- [x] Validate data correctness, including new fields (progress_change, workflow_stage, importance_change, priority_change).

## 4. Module Functionality Tests
- [ ] auto_commit.py:
  - [ ] Test git change detection and grouping.
  - [ ] Test commit message generation.
  - [ ] Test commit, push, and update of commit_task_database.json.
  - [ ] Test progress_change capped at 5%.
  - [ ] Test importance and urgency calculations integration.
- [ ] json_data_linker.py:
  - [ ] Test loading input JSON files.
  - [ ] Test linking and saving intermediate JSON files.
- [ ] importance_urgency_calculator.py:
  - [ ] Test scoring of tasks and subtasks.
  - [ ] Test saving scores to JSON.
- [ ] progress_report.py and importance_urgency_report.py:
  - [ ] Test report generation without errors.

## 5. Integration Tests
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow from input JSON files through intermediate linking, commit processing, and output JSON generation.
- [ ] Test handling of edge cases and error conditions.

## 6. Performance and Stability
- [ ] Test performance on typical project sizes.
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks or crashes.

## 7. Code Quality and Modularity
- [ ] Verify no redundant calculations.
- [ ] Verify modular structure and separation of concerns.

## 8. Documentation and Instructions
- [ ] Verify README and testing instructions are clear and complete.

# Test Execution Notes

- Each test should be marked as Passed or Failed.
- Any issues should be documented with steps to reproduce and logs.
- Testing should be automated where possible.
