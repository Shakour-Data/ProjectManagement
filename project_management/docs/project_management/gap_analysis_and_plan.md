# Gap Analysis and Implementation Plan for PROJECTMANAGEMENT Package

## 1. Overview

This document summarizes the gap analysis of the current PROJECTMANAGEMENT package relative to comprehensive project management concepts and planning techniques from Pressman's chapters 19 and 20. It also outlines a detailed plan to address identified gaps.

---

## 2. Gap Analysis

### 2.1 Intermediate JSON Files (Project Inputs and Outputs)

- **Present:**
  - `detailed_wbs.json`: Well-structured hierarchical WBS covering major project phases and tasks.
  - `commit_task_database.json`: Contains commit-to-task mapping data for progress tracking.

- **Missing:**
  - `workflow_definition.json`: Expected to define workflow steps and task dependencies; currently absent.
  - `commit_progress.json`: Expected to track commit progress per task; currently absent.

### 2.2 Current Features

- WBS aggregation and parsing modules handle modular and textual WBS inputs.
- Progress tracking via git commit logs mapped to tasks.
- Dynamic calculation of task importance and urgency.
- Task management including marking top important tasks as completed.
- Report and dashboard generation for progress and priority/urgency.

### 2.3 Identified Gaps

- Lack of explicit integration of project management knowledge areas:
  - Scope, time, cost, quality, risk, communication, and resource management.
- Missing detailed project planning and estimation techniques:
  - Parametric estimation, COCOMO II, Agile estimation methods.
- Absence of formal risk management processes:
  - Risk identification, qualitative and quantitative analysis, response planning.
- Incomplete workflow definition and progress tracking inputs.
- Limited documentation and user guidance aligned with PMBOK and Pressman standards.

## 3. Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Phase 1: Input and Data Structure Enhancements

- Define and implement `workflow_definition.json` structure to capture workflow steps, dependencies, and statuses.
- Implement `commit_progress.json` generation and management for accurate commit-based progress tracking.
- Extend WBS JSON schema to include fields for cost, quality metrics, risk factors, and resource assignments.

### 3.2 Phase 2: Feature Development

- Develop modules for:
  - Scope management: Define and control project scope changes.
  - Time management: Scheduling, milestone tracking, and critical path analysis.
  - Cost management: Budgeting, cost estimation, and tracking.
  - Quality management: Define quality standards and testing plans.
  - Risk management: Identification, analysis, and mitigation strategies.
  - Communication management: Stakeholder communication plans and logs.
  - Resource management: Allocation, leveling, and utilization tracking.

- Integrate detailed project estimation techniques:
  - Parametric and algorithmic models (e.g., COCOMO II).
  - Agile estimation methods (Planning Poker, Velocity tracking).

### 3.3 Phase 3: Reporting and Documentation

- Enhance dashboards and reports to reflect new knowledge areas and metrics.
- Provide comprehensive user documentation and examples aligned with PMBOK and Pressman.
- Develop training materials and usage guides.

### 3.4 Phase 4: Testing and Validation

- Implement thorough unit and integration tests covering all new features.
- Perform critical-path and full testing cycles as per user preference.
- Maintain `project_management/tests/TEST_CHECKLIST.md` with test coverage and execution logs.

## 4. Next Steps

- Begin Phase 1 by defining missing intermediate JSON files and extending WBS schema.
- Schedule development sprints for phased feature implementation.
- Coordinate testing plans aligned with development progress.
