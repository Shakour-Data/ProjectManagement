# Dashboard and Reports Plan for Project Management Tool

## Overview
This document outlines the key dashboards and reports that should be developed for the project management tool. It also includes the plan to implement the code for generating these dashboards and reports, and the integration of related tasks into the main project workflow.

## Dashboards to be Developed

1. **Progress Dashboard**
   - Real-time visualization of project progress
   - Task completion rates, milestones achieved
   - Burn-down and burn-up charts
   - Scrum-specific views: sprint burndown, velocity charts, sprint backlog

2. **Importance and Urgency Dashboard**
   - Visualization of tasks based on Eisenhower matrix
   - Highlight critical tasks that are both important and urgent
   - Filter and search capabilities by project phase, assignee, etc.

3. **Resource Allocation Dashboard**
   - Overview of resource usage and availability
   - Identification of over-allocated or underutilized resources

4. **Risk Management Dashboard**
   - Tracking identified risks and mitigation status
   - Risk impact and probability heatmaps

5. **Cost Management Dashboard**
   - Budget vs actual expenditure tracking
   - Forecasting and variance analysis

## Reports to be Developed

1. **Importance and Urgency Report**
   - Detailed list of tasks categorized by importance and urgency
   - Includes task metadata, status, and workflow position

2. **Progress Report**
   - Summary of completed, in-progress, and pending tasks
   - Milestone achievement and delays
   - Scrum reports: sprint review, retrospective summaries, velocity reports

3. **Resource Utilization Report**
   - Detailed resource usage statistics
   - Recommendations for reallocation

4. **Risk Report**
   - Comprehensive risk register
   - Status and action plans

5. **Cost Report**
   - Detailed financial report on project costs

## Implementation Plan

- Develop JSON structure for Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) if not already present
- Implement parsers to convert project plans into WBS JSON
- Develop modules for calculating task metrics (importance, urgency, progress)
- Create report generation scripts for each report type
- Develop dashboard UI components integrated with backend data
- Add tasks for dashboard and report development into main project task management system
- Implement automated testing for dashboards and reports
- Develop SQLite database to store all report and dashboard data centrally
- Add task for creating and integrating SQLite database into main project workflow

## Next Steps

- Verify existence and completeness of WBS JSON file
- Prioritize dashboard and report development tasks
- Begin coding and integration as per plan
