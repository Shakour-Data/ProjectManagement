# Detailed Explanation of Stakeholder_Interviews.json

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `Stakeholder_Interviews.json` file located in the `Modeling/Requirements_Gathering` directory. This file is part of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the software project and describes the "Stakeholder Interviews" phase within the Requirements Gathering category.

## File Purpose

The `Stakeholder_Interviews.json` file defines the tasks involved in conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather requirements. It breaks down the interview process into manageable subtasks to facilitate planning, execution, and tracking.

## JSON Structure Breakdown

- **id**: `"WBS-Modeling-1.1"`  
  Unique identifier for this WBS element, indicating it belongs to the Modeling phase and is the 1.1 task.

- **name**: `"Stakeholder Interviews"`  
  The name of this task.

- **description**: `"Conduct interviews with stakeholders to gather requirements."`  
  A brief description of the task's purpose.

- **level_0** to **level_3**:  
  These fields represent the hierarchical levels of the task within the overall project:  
  - `level_0`: "Software Project" (top-level project)  
  - `level_1`: "Modeling" (major phase)  
  - `level_2`: "Requirements Gathering" (sub-phase)  
  - `level_3`: "Stakeholder Interviews" (current task)

- **subtasks**: An array of subtasks that further break down the stakeholder interview task. Each subtask has:  
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the subtask (e.g., `"WBS-Modeling-1.1.1"`)  
  - `name`: Name of the subtask (e.g., `"Prepare Interview Questions"`)  
  - `description`: Description of the subtask's purpose  
  - `level_4`: Hierarchical level name for the subtask  
  - `subtasks`: An empty array indicating no further breakdown for these subtasks

## How to Use This File

- This file serves as an input to project management tools to organize and track stakeholder interview tasks.
- Each subtask can be assigned to team members, scheduled, and monitored.
- The hierarchical structure allows for clear visibility of task dependencies and progress.

---

## Extending the Structure

- This file covers the WBS structure up to level 4, which represents common tasks shared across many software projects.
- To tailor the WBS to your specific project goals, you should further break down each level 4 subtask into three additional levels (e.g., `level_5`, `level_6`, `level_7`).
- These additional levels should be created based on the unique requirements and details of your project.
- When adding these levels, maintain consistent `id` and `level_n` naming conventions to preserve the hierarchy.
- This approach allows you to customize the WBS JSON files to fit your project's specific needs while leveraging the common foundational structure provided.

This detailed explanation should help users understand the role and structure of the `Stakeholder_Interviews.json` file, how it fits into the overall project WBS, and how to extend it to meet specific project requirements.
