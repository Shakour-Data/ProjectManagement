# Detailed Explanation of Requirement_Workshops.json

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `Requirement_Workshops.json` file located in the `Modeling/Requirements_Gathering` directory. This file is part of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the software project and describes the "Requirement Workshops" phase within the Requirements Gathering category.

---

## File Purpose

The `Requirement_Workshops.json` file defines the tasks involved in organizing workshops to elicit requirements. It breaks down the workshop activities into manageable subtasks to facilitate planning, execution, and tracking.

---

## JSON Structure Breakdown

- **id**: `"WBS-Modeling-1.3"`  
  Unique identifier for this WBS element, indicating it belongs to the Modeling phase and is the 1.3 task.

- **name**: `"Requirement Workshops"`  
  The name of this task.

- **description**: `"Organize workshops to elicit requirements."`  
  A brief description of the task's purpose.

- **level_0** to **level_3**:  
  These fields represent the hierarchical levels of the task within the overall project:  
  - `level_0`: "Software Project" (top-level project)  
  - `level_1`: "Modeling" (major phase)  
  - `level_2`: "Requirements Gathering" (sub-phase)  
  - `level_3`: "Requirement Workshops" (current task)

- **subtasks**: An array of subtasks that further break down the workshop activities. Each subtask has:  
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the subtask (e.g., `"WBS-Modeling-1.3.1"`)  
  - `name`: Name of the subtask (e.g., `"Plan Workshops"`)  
  - `description`: Description of the subtask's purpose  
  - `level_4`: Hierarchical level name for the subtask  
  - `subtasks`: An empty array indicating no further breakdown for these subtasks

## Subtasks Description

1. **Plan Workshops**  
   Define objectives and agenda for the workshops.

2. **Invite Participants**  
   Identify and invite relevant stakeholders to participate in the workshops.

3. **Conduct Workshops**  
   Facilitate the workshops to gather requirements from participants.

4. **Document Outcomes**  
   Record and summarize the results and findings from the workshops.

5. **Review and Validate**  
   Review the workshop outcomes with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## How to Use This File

- This file serves as an input to project management tools to organize and track workshop activities.
- Each subtask can be assigned to team members, scheduled, and monitored.
- The hierarchical structure allows for clear visibility of task dependencies and progress.

---

## Extending the Structure

- This file covers the WBS structure up to level 4, which represents common tasks shared across many software projects.
- To tailor the WBS to your specific project goals, you should further break down each level 4 subtask into three additional levels (e.g., `level_5`, `level_6`, `level_7`).
- These additional levels should be created based on the unique requirements and details of your project.
- When adding these levels, maintain consistent `id` and `level_n` naming conventions to preserve the hierarchy.
- This approach allows you to customize the WBS JSON files to fit your project's specific needs while leveraging the common foundational structure provided.

This detailed explanation should help users understand the role and structure of the `Requirement_Workshops.json` file, how it fits into the overall project WBS, and how to extend it to meet specific project requirements.
