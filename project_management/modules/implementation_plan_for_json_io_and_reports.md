# Implementation Plan for JSON-only Input/Output and Full Report/Dashboard JSON Generation

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to refactor and implement the project management modules to:
- Use only JSON files for input and output.
- Communicate exclusively via JSON files.
- Fully implement dashboards and reports as JSON output files according to the specifications in Docs/SystemDesign/12_dashboards.md and Docs/SystemDesign/13_Reports.md.

## Goals
1. Standardize all modules to read JSON input files only from:
   - SystemInputs/output
   - SystemInputs/system_generated
   - SystemInputs/User_Completed
   - SystemInputs/user_inputs
   and their subfolders.

2. Standardize all modules to write JSON output files only to the above folders.

3. Ensure all inter-module communication is via JSON files only.

4. Refactor or implement report and dashboard modules to generate JSON output files that fully meet the detailed specifications in the documentation.

5. Create initial JSON input files in the specified folders as needed to establish file locations and data standards.

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Refactor Input/Output Paths
- Review all modules for hardcoded file paths.
- Update input paths to use only the specified SystemInputs folders.
- Update output paths similarly.
- Remove any non-JSON input/output handling.

### Step 2: Standardize Inter-Module Communication
- Ensure modules do not pass data via function calls or databases.
- All data exchange must be via JSON files in the specified folders.

### Step 3: Implement Dashboard Modules
- Implement the following dashboards as JSON output generators:
  - Cost Management Dashboard
  - Importance and Urgency Dashboard
  - Resource Allocation Dashboard
  - Risk Management Dashboard
  - Progress Dashboard
- Use the detailed feature lists and data sources from Docs/SystemDesign/12_dashboards.md.
- Output JSON files with all required metrics and data structures.

### Step 4: Implement Report Modules
- Implement the following reports as JSON output generators:
  - Cost Report
  - Importance and Urgency Report
  - Progress Report
  - Resource Utilization Report
  - Risk Report
  - GitHub Synchronization Report
- Follow the detailed specifications in Docs/SystemDesign/13_Reports.md.
- Output JSON files with comprehensive report data.

### Step 5: Create Initial JSON Input Files
- Create sample or template JSON input files in the specified folders.
- Ensure they follow the standards documented in Docs/json_inputs_standard/.

### Step 6: Testing and Validation
- Test each module for correct JSON input reading and JSON output writing.
- Validate the completeness and correctness of report and dashboard JSON outputs.
- Ensure no module reads or writes outside the specified folders.
- Verify inter-module communication is exclusively via JSON files.

## Deliverables
- Refactored modules with standardized JSON I/O.
- Fully implemented dashboard and report JSON generators.
- Initial JSON input files in SystemInputs folders.
- Documentation updates as needed.

## Timeline
- Refactoring and standardization: 1 week
- Dashboard implementation: 1 week
- Report implementation: 1 week
- Testing and validation: 1 week

## Notes
- Frontend visualization and markdown report generation are out of scope for now.
- Future work can convert JSON outputs to markdown or UI components.
