# Implementation Plan for Project Management Tool

## Current Tasks
- Implement virtual environment exclusion in .gitignore and setup scripts.
- Create prioritized task execution and reporting.
- Develop and run tests for setup, GitHub integration, progress reporting, and importance/urgency reports.
- Automate project management report updates after each commit operation.

## New Task to Add
- Integrate automatic update of project management reports (progress report and importance/urgency report) after every commit operation in the main project workflow.
- Extend CLI commands or relevant modules to support commit operations and trigger report updates.
- Ensure this integration is documented and tested to avoid being forgotten.

- Implement dynamic task prioritization and filtering logic in the main task management module, allowing user-configurable numbers of tasks to be reported (default to 15 important not in testing, 15 urgent not in testing, 10 important in testing, 10 urgent in testing).
- Ensure this dynamic prioritization is integrated consistently across the project and exposed for user configuration.

## Notes
- This task is critical to maintain up-to-date project status and task prioritization.
- Coordination with auto_commit.py and CLI command handling is required.
- User requested to add this task explicitly to the implementation plan to avoid forgetting it.
